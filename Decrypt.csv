"Coins","Binance to Bring Bitcoin NFTs to Its Marketplace Through Ordinals Support","Coins","The leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, announced today that it will support Ordinals inscriptions on its NFT marketplace later this month, dipping its toes into the buzzy Bitcoin-based market.

The update to Binance’s NFT marketplace is expected to roll out “in the coming weeks,” the company said, enabling users to purchase and trade Ordinals inscriptions via their Binance accounts.

The NFT marketplace expanded its roster of supported networks in March when it added certain NFT collections from Polygon to the platform. Offered alongside NFTs on Ethereum and BNB Chain, Binance’s Head of Product Mayur Kamat called support for Bitcoin—crypto’s largest token by market cap—a notable addition.

“Bitcoin is the OG of crypto,” he said. “We believe things are just getting started here and can’t wait to see what the future holds in this space.”

BNB Sets All-Time High, Days After Binance Announces NFT Marketplace

BNB, the native token for the crypto exchange Binance and the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, hit a new all-time high of $636.95 at 3am UTC today.  The coin’s price has since retreated to $616, down 0.52% in the last 24 hours. BNB is in a very healthy place right now; the last time it was anywhere near this valuable was on April 13, when it hit its former ATH of $635. What’s behind the rally?

Several inscriptions marketplaces cropped up amid Ordinals’ initial surge in popularity, like Ordswap, Ordinals Market, and Ordinals Wallet. And Magic Eden, the largest Solana NFT marketplace, was the first among established venues to throw its hat into the Ordinals ring, launching an inscriptions marketplace in March.

The announcement from Binance’s NFT marketplace comes just days after the exchange temporarily paused Bitcoin withdrawals, blaming the outage on network congestion while its competitors remained fully operational. The pause came at a time when Bitcoin transaction fees were sky-high and the network’s mempool—where transactions wait to be verified—was severely backlogged.

The consensus on Crypto Twitter was that transactions related to BRC-20 tokens were weighing on the network. Built and traded using Ordinals, the same protocol that yields so-called Bitcoin NFTs, BRC-20 tokens are coins built on top of Bitcoin using text-based inscriptions as opposed to image-based inscriptions. 

The current iteration of Binance's Bitcoin NFT marketplace doesn't support BRC-20 tokens, Kamat told Decrypt.

Over the past couple of weeks, image-based inscriptions have been largely overshadowed by these new, Bitcoin-based tokens and text-based inscriptions. 

On Sunday, 99.7% of inscriptions made through Ordinals were text-based, according to a Dune dashboard. At the same time, 65% of all Bitcoin transactions were related to BRC-20 tokens, according to another Dune dashboard.

"Gaming","Why a 'Blair Witch' Producer Is Turning 'Mandala' Comic Into a Game","Gaming","This story comes from GG.
Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up

Veteran Hollywood producer Kevin Foxe wants to form a “rebel alliance” against the large corporations that control the film industry and traditional media, he told Decrypt—and he plans to use crypto and gamification to do it.

Foxe is the executive producer of the 1999 cult classic horror film “The Blair Witch Project.” In an interview with Decrypt, Foxe shared his philosophy on crypto and media, the Hollywood studio system, and why he’s looking to expand the world of the 2014 Dark Horse Comics graphic novel “Mandala” into a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).

AD

Nearly a decade ago, Foxe began collaborating with the creators of the “Mandala” comics—writer Stuart Moore and artist Bruce Zick—to explore potential adaptations. The source material is tonally grim, merging elements of the occult and spiritual mysticism with an apocalyptic, biting critique of corporate power and surveillance states.

Why 'Blair Witch' Exec Producer Kevin Foxe Is '1,000% In' on Gaming

""The Blair Witch Project"" Executive Producer Kevin Foxe wants to avoid corporate overlords and enlighten fans of the dark ""Mandala"" graphic novel with a video game adaptation and NFTs across multiple blockchains.

Go to video page

It follows protagonist Mike Morningstar as he fights against the GRID, a “global mind-control system,” with a group of superhero-like mythological characters known as The Thirteen. Shortly after release, horror-focused publication Bloody Disgusting called the graphic novel a “killer” that “missed popularity for some reason.""

Like other filmmakers and artists building their next projects in Web3, Foxe doesn’t want the next ""Mandala"" iterations to be of a singular type. Instead, he has plans for a television series and a video game, as well as other community-driven experiences that “gamify” the ""Mandala"" experience.

“I envision being able to tell a story to an audience across many platforms,” Foxe said, adding that he sees multimedia platforms suitable for a project that explores multiple universes and simultaneous timelines. “And I love the idea of using tech to tell stories,” he added.

With ""Mandala,"" Foxe collectively calls the project’s many elements an “enlightenment simulator,” which he hopes will help its participants recognize potential elements of truth in the material's broader themes.

“I hate to sound like this, but we're sort of a rebel alliance fighting against these big corporate entities that will take our data and will take our privacy and are working against all of that,” Foxe said of his decision to develop ""Mandala"" in Web3.

Foxe said that a ""Mandala"" television series, which was previously in development at Warner Bros. before the AT&T acquisition in 2018, is still in the works—and his team retained the IP rights, he told Decrypt.

AD

“We walked away with it. We have all of the content, all of the IP. I mean, that was another sticking point for us, right? The studio wants to then own the IP,” Foxe said of the project's departure from the studio system. 

“Having done a number of projects at big studios who now own my IP, I thought, ‘This is a time where that has to change.’ And blockchain does offer that,” he added. “It offers an opportunity to continually own your IP, but still invite the audience in and hopefully reward them in ways that the studio can't.”

Mandala the MMORPG

Foxe’s vision for ""Mandala"" has always been about it becoming a game, he told Decrypt.

“That was what it started as. It will be an MMORPG,” he said. “But we’re also trying to gamify the process along the way as we move into Web3.” 

The ""Mandala"" team is looking to build the game in “tranches,” Foxe shared, because he sees crypto as moving much faster than the time it takes to build a video game. His team is currently looking for a Web3-savvy “game partner” to help build out the title, but has already developed some game environments and characters using Epic Games’ Unreal Engine. 

“I constantly look to Tim Sweeney and Epic because I think they have it figured out,” Foxe said of the Fortnite creator and its CEO. “We’re really following their lead and hoping to work with them real soon.”

""Mandala"" has already experimented with NFTs across multiple chains—there are profile pictures (PFPs) on Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cardano, with plans to release future NFTs on the Polygon-powered Immutable zkEVM network.

Go to video page

When asked if the existing ""Mandala"" NFTs will play a role in the game, Foxe said that such details haven’t been decided just yet—but suggested that there are already “rabbit holes” for fans to explore in the metadata that defines the tokens’ unique attributes.

“We believe in cross-chain, we believe in interoperability,” Foxe said. “And we believe the audience has to come together from wherever you are to fight back against the grid that’s trapping us all.”

"Artificial Intelligence","Warren ‘Bitcoin Is Rat Poison’ Buffett Likens AI to the Atom Bomb","Artificial Intelligence","Bitcoin is rat poison, in the view of Berkshire Hathaway's chairman and CEO, Warren Buffett, and its vice chair Charlie Munger. But for them, there's something even worse: AI.

The two legends of the business world held their annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, joined by Vice Chairs Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, and they spoke freely—not only about their business but also about their perspectives on geopolitics, finance, and the future of investments.

For Warren Buffett, the constant evolution of AI tools could become a Damocles' sword capable of causing more harm to humanity than benefit, especially if society begins to rely excessively on it.

""It can do all kinds of things and when something can do all kinds of things I get a little bit worried,"" said Buffett about artificial intelligence.

In a Monday Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the American cryptocurrency exchange said it had more than 100,000 creditors with estimated liabilities and assets both within the $500 million to $1 billion range.

AD

The filing comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against Bittrex, alleging it had failed to comply with securities law by not registering with the financial watchdog.

The SEC's criminal complaint alleged that the exchange failed to register as a broker-dealer, exchange, and clearing agency—and that it took in at least $1.3 billion in illicit revenue between 2017 and 2022.

In March, Bittrex said it was winding down U.S. operations, with its CEO Richie Lai citing the ""current U.S. regulatory and economic environment"" as reasons for the decision. The exchange at the time assured U.S. customers that their funds would be safe.

Bittrex is a small Seattle-based company, founded in 2013. With a current 24-hour trading volume of little over $5 million, it is the 82nd largest digital asset exchange, according to CoinGecko.

"Coins","Ben 'Bitboy' Armstrong Shills BEN—A ‘Ben DAO’ Token for Dudes Named Ben","Coins","Newly created token, BEN, launched a few days ago. But it really took off on Crypto Twitter when YouTuber Ben ""Bitboy"" Armstrong said he'd gotten involved on Monday.

On May 6th, Twitter user ben.eth, announced the contract address alongside the chart of the token trading against Wrapped Ether (WETH), as well as a newly created Telegram group.

AD

As of Monday afternoon, the token had seen a lot of volatility. Its price soared 300% in the morning, only to drop 200% a few hours later, according to CoinMarketCap. So far, BEN appears to be trading on decentralized exchange Uniswap and has about $2 million worth of liquidity.

BEN has prompted famed crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, commonly known as BitBoy Crypto, to get involved, tweeting that the coin is live and that: “People all want to invest in themselves and now Bens can do that.”

""People think I launched the token. I had nothing to do with the creation. The creator, founder, & LP holder is ben.eth on Twitter,"" Armstrong told Decrypt. ""This coin was spurred out of a telegram group consisting of only people named Ben. There are several high profile Bens in there like Ben Goertzel, Ben Lakeoff, Ben Noble and other respected Bens in the space.""

He added that he's now joined the team that originally launched the token.

News of BitBoy’s comments comes amid ongoing legal battles he is facing for allegedly promoting infamous crypto exchange FTX. Armstrong is one of several influencers being sued in a class action suit by investors who lost money when the platform collapsed.

More recently, though, he made headlines for threatening tweets against the lawyers representing investors behind the lawsuit. As such, a judge ordered him to be blocked from engaging online with Adam Moskowitz, the attorney leading the case.

But the ongoing lawsuit has not stopped Armstrong from continuing to produce content, or getting involved in the launch of BEN. He still has a substantial online presence, with 1 million Twitter followers and 1.4 million YouTube subscribers.

For a while CoinMarketCap showed that BEN had a $16.5 million dollar market capitalization with a disclaimer that it couldn't be verified. Since then, the site has stopped displaying the market cap. At the time of writing, the token's 24-hour volume has topped $47 million.

AD

BEN comes amid a recent craze led on by a spur of meme coins, with PEPE coin leading the way after surpassing a $1 billion dollar market cap. PEPE rose about $1 billion after Binance announced that it would add the token to its innovation zone, a section of the exchange that traders can access only after acknowledging that they could potentially lose a ton of money betting on memes and that it would be their fault if they did.

BRC-20 tokens have existed for two months. They were pioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo, who took inspiration from the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum and launched a token called ORDI on March 8.

Since then, Ordi has reached a market cap of around $400 million, according to brc-20.io. Other BRC-20 tokens like PEPE (a different token than the currently-hot Ethereum meme token of the same name), MEME, PIZA, and DOMO have followed suit as Bitcoin goes through the kind of meme coin mania that has gripped the wider crypto market in the past with Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and BONK.

On Monday, Ordi was listed for trading on Crypto.com and Gate.io, suggesting the experimental token is gaining mainstream adoption on cryptocurrency exchanges. As of this writing, the price of Ordi was $18.50 on Gate.io, a notable drop from its peak of $29.58 set earlier in the day.

Still, the current price of Ordi represents a steep increase from its price just one week ago, when Ordi traded hands at $3.78 on May 1, according to brc-20.io.

The volatility of BRC-20 tokens highlights the emergent nature of the Ordinals space, as text-based inscriptions—used to create and trade the tokens—take over and image-based inscriptions become less common. Yesterday, over 399,000 inscriptions were text-based compared to 20 that were image-based, according to data from Dune.

But it has now erased those gains and is down 6.7% in the past week.

It has taken the rest of the market with it, too: Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, is down more than 5% in the past day and is priced in at $1,826.

All of the major cryptocurrencies were also in the red in the past day: Dogecoin dropped by 7% in 24 hours to touch $0.07, while Polygon took a 8.6% hit and was trading for $0.89.

On Wednesday, investors will look to the CPI report to gauge the Federal Reserve’s progress in bringing down inflation. The index tracks price movements across a broad range of goods and services.

Investors have typically sold ""risk assets""—investments that experience volatile price movements—when the the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates to tame inflation.

Bitcoin has closely been related to the U.S. equity market (largely tech stocks) and has dipped in price whenever America's central bank has tightened monetary policy. Although many investors have cheered for Bitcoin's decoupling from stocks a few times over, it hasn't happened yet.

Transaction fees in the block clocked in at 6.7 Bitcoin, beating the block subsidy of 6.25 Bitcoin.

Though this spike in fees has thrown a curveball to users, this block shows how it's benefitting Bitcoin miners, the global network of volunteers that run expensive, specialized computers to secure the Bitcoin network. They’re the ones raking in this newfound treasure trove of fees.

AD

Bitcoin miners have two sources of income built in for them. One is the block subsidy. Roughly every 10 minutes, miners are awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. This value is split in half every four years in an event known as the Bitcoin “halvening.”

The second source is transaction fees. Users optionally can tag on a fee to every Bitcoin transaction. If there's more demand for Bitcoin, users need to hike their fee if they want it to get through in a timely manner. There's been lots of demand recently, pushing the average fee up to $19 according to cryptocurrency statistics website BitInfoCharts.

As such, the transaction fee source of income fluctuates somewhat erratically with demand.

One reason bitcoiners find this surplus in fees so monumental is that eventually — in more than a hundred years — transaction fees will be miners' sole source of income. But transaction fees fluctuate so often, it hasn’t yet been proven that it will provide a consistent source of income when that time finally rolls around.

Miners are the glue holding Bitcoin together. The more hashing power provided by miners securing Bitcoin, the more secure Bitcoin is. But miners are unlikely to secure the network if they aren’t paid to do it. Therefore it could be bad for Bitcoin if transaction fees don’t increase over the years.

Block 788695 is a small, optimistic sign that fees could increase, even if it hasn't proved a consistent form of income for miners just yet. As self-custody platform Casa CTO Jameson Lopp put it on Twitter: ""The model for thermodynamic security has been proven possible. The only remaining question is if this demand is sustainable.""

"Business","Rep. Tom Emmer Claims Democrats Support His CBDC Bill—But Can't Say it Publicly","Business","Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) said on Monday his CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act has gained significant traction among lawmakers, including some that haven’t stepped forward publicly.

Introduced in February, the legislation would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) directly to Americans or using the technology to shape monetary policy. It would also make the U.S. central bank subject to greater oversight when studying or piloting a digital dollar.

AD

The bill initially had nine co-sponsors, but that number has since grown to include 14 other members of Congress, bringing the current total to 23. All of them are Republicans, but that just includes the politicians who have put their names on the legislation.

CBDCs Could 'Revolutionize Global Financial Systems': Bank of America

At least 114 central banks—representing 58% of all countries, which generate 95% of global GDP—are now exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), up from 35 in May 2020. And a team of cryptocurrency analysts from Bank of America is unabashedly bullish on the tech. “Digital currencies appear inevitable,” a new research report from BofA concludes. “We view distributed ledgers and digital currencies, such as CBDCs and stablecoins, as a natural evolution of today’s monetary and payment syste...

“It's not just a crypto-friendly Republicans,” he said during a discussion hosted by the Federalist Society, a conservative law group.

There’s been support from outside his party, too.

“I believe we have significant support on the other side of the aisle as well, even though they right now cannot be public with that support because the administration is not necessarily favorable,” he said of Democratic lawmakers.

CBDCs parallel digital assets like stablecoins, which are tokens pegged to the price of a sovereign currency, like the U.S. dollar. But instead of being managed by a private company, CBDCs are issued and maintained by their respective governments or central banks.

While some view CBDCs as a natural evolution of cash that could foster greater financial inclusion, Emmer and others have criticized the technology as a tool for surveillance that could be prone to abuses of power.

Those critical toward a CBDC, including Emmer, have raised privacy concerns, arguing it would allow the government to monitor transactions and spending habits, eroding privacy rights. The Fed’s Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr acknowledged privacy concerns in March, saying a CBDC should offer privacy that mirrors bank deposits.

Fed Chair Ponders Potential for Digital Dollar to Send Bitcoin to Zero

U.S. Congressman Stephen Lynch (D-MA) expressed concern Wednesday over the possible impact of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), asking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to ponder the potential for a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar to wipe out other digital assets. Lynch's comments came as Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee, fielding a series of questions about digital assets. “I'm worried about a lot of these stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies,” Ly...

The Fed has said repeatedly that it will not issue a retail-facing CBDC without approval from Congress as well, which would be used by Americans in everyday purchases. Yet, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled a CBDC for financial institutions is different.

AD

Emmer described the distinction between a retail and wholesale CBDC on Monday as “word soup that the Fed, and the Treasury, and all these bureaucrats put out.”

Ultimately, he argued that a CBDC should adhere to ideals within the Web3 space, bearing a resemblance to stablecoins if at all possible.

“If you could do an open, permissionless, private cash simulation, we should all be willing to hear what our central government is talking about,” Emmer said. “But as long as you can't do that, then you should not be in the business of creating a central bank digital currency.”

"Business","Bitcoin Payment Option 'Is Coming', Says Liechtenstein's Prime Minister","Business","Liechtenstein is planning to accept Bitcoin (BTC) as payment for state services, Prime Minister Daniel Risch said in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt.

""A payment option with Bitcoin is coming,"" said Risch, who also serves as Liechtenstein’s finance minister.

AD

Although there isn't a specific timeframe for the implementation of this payment option, Risch said the plan is to accept Bitcoin deposits and exchange them immediately for the Swiss franc, Liechtenstein’s national currency.

A similar approach has been used by the Swiss communities Zug and Lugano, where local authorities accept Bitcoin for the payment of certain taxes and public services.

Risch is also reportedly open to investing state funds in Bitcoin in the future.

With the state's reserves currently standing at 2.23 billion Swiss francs ($2.51 billion), the principality each year saves three times its 900 million-franc ($1 billion) annual budget, investing the money in capital markets.

Part of those funds could be invested in the world’s largest cryptocurrency, per the report.

“Crypto assets like Bitcoin are currently still too risky,” Risch said. “But this assessment can change.”

"NFTs","First Quarter NFT Volumes Outpace Q4 Thanks to Blur Token Airdrop","NFTs","NFT trading volumes on Ethereum surged in Q1 2023 compared to the previous quarter, thanks in part to the airdrop farming frenzy for Blur’s native token.

Blur is an NFT marketplace and aggregator that launched in October 2022. The project scheduled an airdrop of the platform’s native token, BLUR, on February 14, 2023, which brought significant traction from airdrop hunters in the first quarter.

AD

Data shared with Decrypt by crypto analytics firm Nansen shows that NFT trading volume more than doubled in 2023 from $1.9 billion worth of NFTs traded in Q4 2022 versus $4.5 billion in Q1 2023.

While trading volumes increased more than two-fold, the number of unique wallets trading NFTs increased modestly by 24.5% during the same period. There were 13.9 million users in Q1 2023 compared to 11.2 million users in Q4 2022.

The above data suggest that existing users were trading at a higher volume rather than a significant increase in new users, which can again likely be traced to the BLUR token airdrop.

Bearish Spring for NFT Market

Looking more closely at NFT activity for this spring shows a slightly more bearish picture despite the yearly trend.

The month of April saw a 30% decline in trading volumes across a variety of marketplaces when compared to March.

The situation worsened this month as Nansen reported that the first week of May saw the “lowest number of sales and users” this year. The number of weekly NFT sales dropped to around 370,000.

The trading volumes in May have fallen back to bearish levels of 2022 with around 90,000 ETH traded weekly.

Though there's been a dip in ETH traded, trading volumes in USD terms are nonetheless due to Ethereum's rather bullish start to the year.

AD

The second-largest asset by market capitalization was trading below $1,300 in Q4 last year; today that figure is closer to $1,900.

"Business","Binance Calls Bitcoin Withdrawal Pause 'a Learning Opportunity'","Business","Crypto exchange Binance has resumed Bitcoin withdrawals after a temporary pause, with transactions shown as successfully sent to users’ wallets. There still may be delays with the actual transaction verifications, however.

Binance twice paused Bitcoin withdrawals from its platform in the past 24 hours citing “a congestion issue,” inevitably leading to massive speculation of the exchange's health on social media.

AD

The exchange, the world’s largest in terms of trading volume, moved to address the issue, saying it adjusted its miner fees.

The exchange also noted that it would continue to monitor on-chain activity, hinting that it was also exploring the use of Bitcoin's Lightning Network to speed up withdrawal times.

""We’re looking to enable BTC Lightning network withdrawals for users within the next few months. The BTC Lightning network works just like any network; users can withdraw via the Lightning network from the Binance platform into their private wallets. More details will be shared by our team once they are available,"" a Binance spokesperson told Decrypt.

Bitcoin mempool clogged

The pause on Bitcoin withdrawals from Binance occurred amid a drastic increase in unconfirmed transactions, with data from Timechaincalendar showing more than 420,000 pending transactions going back as many as 55 blocks at the time of this writing.

The Bitcoin mempool, short for ""memory pool,"" is a type of data structure used by the Bitcoin network to store unconfirmed transactions. When a Bitcoin user initiates a transaction, it is broadcast to the network and added to the mempool of each full node that receives it.

The mempool acts as a waiting room of sorts for transactions before they're included in a block by a miner. Miners prioritize transactions with higher fees, so transactions with lower fees or larger sizes may be left in the mempool for a longer period.

One of the possible reasons for the latest surge in Bitcoin transaction fees, which are currently commanding 245 sat/vB, or $9.55, for low-priority transactions, according to mempool.space, is Bitcoin’s sizable backlog to Ordinals, a protocol used for minting NFT-like assets on Bitcoin.

AD

Called inscriptions, the total number of Bitcoin-based digital assets surged past 4.6 million on Monday, according to data available at Dune Analytics.

To put that in perspective, just last week, Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions totaled 2.5 million.

Binance outflows

Another point of concern for some users was the large Bitcoin outflows from the exchange. These, however, appear to be the movements of funds between Binance's hot and cold wallets.

“A lot of people commenting about the huge Bitcoin outflows from Binance today. Two transactions of 117K and 40K Bitcoin respectively. In reality, these are Bitcoin sent to newly-created change addresses that belong to Binance. Effective outflows are most likely just 10,100 Bitcoin,” tweeted Julio Moreno, head of research at on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant.

Binance confirmed this too, saying that “this ‘outflow’ are actually movements between Binance hot and cold wallets due to the BTC address adjustments.”

The exchange has also referred to DefiLlama's data “for accurate information” regarding its wallet movements.

Despite all reassurances, the price of Bitcoin nonetheless dropped to a week low of $27,790 on Monday morning.

The leading cryptocurrency changed hands at $27,955 at the time of writing, down 3% over the day, per CoinGecko.

"Markets","SUI, PEPE Lead Market Losses, Down Double Digits Overnight","Markets","The popular meme coin rally fueling the rise of Pepecoin (PEPE) appears to have finally begun to slow.

Per CoinGecko, PEPE has fallen by nearly 11% this morning. Still, over the week, the meme coin has risen a whopping 215%.

AD

Launched mid-April, the frog-inspired token quickly gathered steam, entering the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap last week. Today, PEPE is the 52nd-largest cryptocurrency and has a market capitalization of $965 million at press time.

The rally was helped along after Binance listed PEPE and Floki Inu (FLOKI) in it’s so-called Innovation Zone. Per the exchange, this zone is meant to host hyper-volatile cryptocurrencies, with interested investors expected to understand the potential for total loss.

Alongside PEPE, Sui network’s native SUI token also dropped 11% overnight.

The Move-based blockchain network’s mainnet launched last week, along with an initial distribution of tokens.

While the project’s launch brought considerable attention to the Sui ecosystem, its NFT ecosystem, in particular, exploded as users looked to mint the earliest collections on the network.

The token likely saw selling pressure due to the massive gains for around 96,000 community members who purchased 1,500 SUI tokens for $45. The team unlocked 528 million out of the total SUI’s supply of 10 billion.

This small investment turned to over $3,200 at last week’s peak price of $2.16, according to CoinGecko data.

Amid today’s bearish move, this would suggest that at least a few of those traders are grabbing profits.

AD
SUI tokenomics take center stage

Amid the heightened selling pressure on SUI, analysts have also raised concerns about tokens allocated to market makers and investors.

For starters, market makers have been allocated 75% of the token’s initial circulating supply. Analysts have called the hefty distribution to market makers “predatory” as market makers usually hedge their positions, which creates potential selling pressure if they decide to close their positions.

Additionally, around 44% of the total supply is allocated toward the team, investors, and early contributors.

Data from TokenUnlocks shows that the vesting schedule has a significant unlock of 14% of its total supply in December 2023.

There are currently over 469,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed in Bitcoin’s mempool as of this writing, according to mempool.space. Before transactions are added to Bitcoin’s blockchain, transactions are sent to the network’s mempool, where they wait to be selected by a Bitcoin miner and inserted into Bitcoin’s next block.

Bitcoin transaction fees were also quite high, with high-priority transactions commanding a rate of 654 sat/vB, or around $26, according to mempool.space.

“High transaction fees are the chosen pain point by the attacker, probably to make [...] Bitcoin unusable for smaller players,” claimed @proofofjogi on Twitter on Sunday. “We're in the then-they-fight-you-stage.”

The notion that high transaction fees could be used as an “attack vector” toward Bitcoin was echoed by Bitcoin-maxi Dylan LeClair. But he claimed that driving up costs in the short term has a negligible impact on Bitcoin in the long run.

One user on Twitter named @Toma_7_32 pointed out that clogging up Bitcoin’s mempool mainly benefits miners, “​​who are having a blast” while reaping the rewards associated with higher transaction fees, despite what some are labeling an ""'attack' on Bitcoin.""

AD

The account claimed that it was only a matter of time before those flooding Bitcoin’s mempool with transactions run out of money, making any impact on the network short-lived.

Still, others attributed the uptick in transaction fees and Bitcoin’s sizable backlog to Ordinals, a protocol used for minting NFT-like assets on Bitcoin. Called inscriptions, the total number of Bitcoin-based digital assets cruised past 4.3 million on Sunday, according to a Dune dashboard. Just last week, inscriptions totaled 2.5 million, based on Decrypt coverage.

The recent increase in inscriptions can be attributed to the growing popularity of BRC-20 tokens, which were originally pioneered as an experiment in March. Some exchanges like UniSat Wallet have created ways for people to trade these tokens built on top of Bitcoin, which bear a resemblance to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.

On Sunday alone, UniSat Wallet had done over $9.3 million worth of inscriptions trading volume, as of this writing, according to another Dune dashboard. The figure coincided with roughly 7,500 transactions.

The Fed’s mid-week announcement of the tenth consecutive interest rate hike since March 2022 capped crypto’s growth this week, leaving many leading cryptocurrencies level with—or a little south of—the prices they were trading at this time last week.

On Monday, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao flagged Tron CEO Justin Sun’s $56 million token transfer to the exchange, suggesting the Tron founder might use the funds to farm a soon-to-be-launched token called SUI.

Sun immediately set the record straight on his end, calling the transfer a mistake and offering CZ an apology. Tron reps later confirmed to Decrypt that the refund had been executed.

Zhao’s argument that Binance’s launchpool airdrops are “for our retail users” has broader significance when you consider the not-so-retail-friendly token distribution of SUI, as seen in this chart by crypto analyst Tom Dunleavy (@Dunleavy89).

"Coins","Meme Coin ‘Speedrun’ Goes Viral, Sparks Scam Concerns","Coins","Ready. Set. Token.

That’s the gist of a video shared by digital artist Johnny Shankman, also known as @iamwhitelights on Twitter, where the Brooklyn-based creator takes a time-centered approach toward creating a new coin. 

AD

With a few flicks of the cursor and some fast typing, Shankman is able to write and deploy a smart contract for a token called EASY_MONEY. The entire process took a total of 27 seconds, documenting what is perhaps the first meme coin speedrun. 

Speedrunning has decades-old roots in the gaming community, dating back to retro classics like Dragster and Super Mario Kart, where players try to complete video games as fast as possible. But Shankman’s video takes a time-tested method for mastering video games and applies it to Web3 tech.

The artist's display of dexterity comes amid a meme coin frenzy, where tokens like Pepe and Wojak are notching notable gains. Many of these emergent meme tokens are ERC-20 tokens, meaning they are built on Ethereum’s network using smart contracts and adhere to a standard set of rules. 

Shankman’s method for churning out EASY_MONEY involves using a so-called Contracts Wizard created by the crypto cybersecurity firm OpenZeppelin. The tool can generate code for an ERC-20 token based on just a handful of inputs. Then, using the application Remix, the token’s smart contract is compiled and deployed in seconds.

On Saturday, the artist warned that the video was made “for educational purposes only” and that his EASY_MONEY token was “deployed on [a] testnet,” indicating it wasn’t a full-fledged launch. Additionally, he called attention to a token using the same name as his example that he “did not make,” adding he “will not be buying it.”

Improving on Shankman’s meme coin speedrun, a user named @0xdiid on Twitter was able to shave off a handful of seconds, bringing the unofficial world record down to 22.45 seconds, according to their post.

AD

The original video was shared by numerous influential accounts on Crypto Twitter like @Loopifyyy and @3orovik, amassing millions of views. The speedrun’s reach led @notthreadguy to comment, “Shitcoin season is far from over.”

A crypto-centric term for referring to altcoins in a pejorative manner, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has acknowledged that the “shitcoin” label is somewhat subjective. And anyone can create a token given the permissionless nature of Web3.

Still, meme coins are far from just a joke, carrying the potential for astronomic gains but often leading to FOMO that can be leveraged by bad actors. The online blockchain sleuth @ZachXBT, known for exposing crypto scams, pointed out how many times a repost of the speedrun had been bookmarked, responding, “wtf.”

As of this writing, @Loopifyyy’s post had garnered over 14,000 bookmarks on Twitter, outpacing both likes and retweets. “You just showed how to make a rug, we are doomed,” a user commented, alluding to the common crypto scam where a token’s development team suddenly disappears as an asset’s value tanks.

While Pepe is a notable standout, an influx of other meme coins, whether that’s Guacamole, Good Gensler, or Ignore Fud has made obscure tokens undoubtedly in vogue among some traders. On Twitter, @SlorgoftheSlugs claimed the speedrun will give way to an “oversaturation” of new, unproven tokens.

But not everyone thought the speedrun’s widespread reach was problematic, such as @RepeatAfterVee on Twitter, who argued, “The more people know how easy it is to create a token, the more likely they will think twice before buying these worthless numbers on the screen.”

AD

And the speedrun’s original creator agreed, adding it can make the mystique of meme tokens less of a potential danger.

“Once you know how these work, it doesn’t make them valueless or easier to make,” Shankman wrote, “Just a little harder to fall for a rug, I like to think, since you know what’s under the hood.”

Before they’re added to Bitcoin’s blockchain, transactions are broadcast to the network’s mempool where they wait to be selected by miners and inserted into Bitcoin’s next block. Currently, a sizable backlog of Bitcoin transactions is driving up transaction fees.

As of Sunday afternoon, the total number of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions in the network's mempool totaled around 395,000, according to mempool.space. On April 26, that figure was 56,500, according to Blockchain.com.

At the same time, transaction fees on Bitcoin were sky-high. According to data from YCharts, Bitcoin transaction fees reached their highest levels in almost two years on Friday, averaging $9.62 per transaction. 

AD

On Saturday, transaction fees averaged around $8.84, suggesting they were trending back down. Still, it represented an over 500% increase compared to six months ago, when Bitcoin transactions averaged around $1.45.

The uptick in congestion and higher transaction fees coincides with a steep rise in the number of inscriptions made through Ordinals, as people use the protocol for minting NFT-like assets on Bitcoin to create and trade fungible, BRC-20 tokens.

Started as an experiment in March by a pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast named Domo, the market cap of BRC-20 tokens—which mirror ERC-20 tokens—has ballooned to $446 million, according to brc-20.io.

A week ago, the total number of inscriptions snowballed past 2.5 million. And as of Sunday, the total number of inscriptions cruised past 4.3 million, according to a widely-used Dune dashboard.

"NFTs","Forget FOMO—JOMO Effect NFT Project Aims to Boost Mental Health in Web3","NFTs","""FOMO,"" or the ""fear of missing out,"" can stress out NFT and crypto traders looking for the next big thing—but a new NFT project is attempting to spread “JOMO” in Web3 instead while raising money for charitable causes.

With Mental Health Awareness Month underway, the JOMO Effect NFT project looks to sprinkle positivity throughout the community and counteract the anxiety that can come from keeping up with the fast-moving space. JOMO is short for ""joy of missing out,"" a decidedly different sensation from FOMO.

AD

The JOMO Effect NFT collection is the brainchild of Peace Inside Live, a collective of content creators, digital artists, and mental health and wellness advocates. Peace Inside Live began its journey during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is also when the NFT space first surged to towering peaks.

Dropping on May 10, JOMO Effect is a collection of 40 unique digital art collectibles by various artists with a focus on wellness and mental health. The project will be available via the Magic Eden marketplace and minted on Ethereum scaling network, Polygon.

Artists and partners joining in the collection include spiritual thinker Deepak Chopra’s Seva Love project, Time magazine’s TimePieces, House of First, Jeremy Fall, Jana Stern, Brittany Pierre, Coco Stardust, Dr. Lemny Perez, Jimena Buena Vida, Kira Bursky, and Kristina Flynn.

Minting a JOMO Effect NFT will cost 24 MATIC (about $23 today) in the public sale, and proceeds from the drop will benefit five mental health charities: Aakoma Project, Half The Story, The MINDS Foundation, LOVELOUD Foundation, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

Collectors who buy at least five JOMO Effect NFTs will receive a special edition Adam Bomb Squad NFT for every set of five, and those who collect all 40 unique NFTs will receive extra perks, including tickets to events by TimePieces and House of First.

“Web3 can be a lonely space, as much as it preaches community, because our entire worlds live online disconnected from other humans,” artist Fall told Decrypt. “I’ve been an avid advocate of mental health awareness over the last few years, and think it’s something that needs to be more prominent in Web3. 'JOMO' is an interesting new way to help convey a message by bringing artists together.”

Fellow contributing artist Pierre, meanwhile, told Decrypt that she has ""experienced FOMO to the nth degree"" during her two years in the space. ""It’s important to stand back and see the bigger picture,"" she added.

AD
Why JOMO?

FOMO took hold in the NFT market amid the 2021 surge, as traders volleyed to mint artwork and collectibles that often brought considerable returns when sold—what traders sometimes jokingly called ""generational wealth"" from flipping JPEGs.

As the market has struggled and become ever more volatile over the last year, traders have struggled amid diminishing demand as fewer bets on NFTs have panned out in terms of returns—not to mention a prevalence of scams, hacks, and exploits that see collectors parted with their NFTs and/or money.

“FOMO is a pretty unique flavor of anxiety,” Peace Inside Live co-founder Jordana Reim told Decrypt. “We have been really focused on supporting mental well-being, and one of the mental plagues that we have felt very deeply—particularly in tech and Web3—is anxiety.”

Another term has also become synonymous with crypto: “FUD,” or “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” Last summer, the Bear Market Screaming Therapy Group was formed on Telegram to give crypto traders a place to voice (or yell) their feelings about the state of the market. November's collapse of FTX only amplified the broader anxiety in the crypto world, alongside other notable platform shutdowns. Events like these helped inspire the JOMO Effect initiative.

“I hope that on the other side of this mint that we change—even a little bit—the way we build Web3, with a focus on well-being,” she continued. “Because if the people building Web3 and the new world are not OK, then nothing will get built.”

Peace Inside Live co-founder Shira Lazar said that in addition to using the Polygon blockchain to mint the NFTs, Polygon Labs also worked closely with the group and supported the JOMO Effect project with Twitter Spaces and promotion.

The JOMO Effect was also created in partnership with Deepak Chopra’s Seva Love and the Chopra Foundation to offer mental health-focused benefits for NFT holders, including an exclusive online meditation with Chopra.

"Coins","This Week in Coins: Bitcoin and Ethereum Stand Still After Fed Rate Hike","Coins","Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.

After posting small gains last weekend, the price growth of crypto market leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) slowed to effectively nothing this week. 

AD

Bitcoin remains at the level it was this time last weekend, hovering around $28.820, a decrease of about 5% from its April high of $30,979 set nearly three weeks ago but still about 77% up from the start of January when the price was $16,615. 

Ethereum added 4.2% to its value over the seven days and currently changes hands at $1,885, a decline of about 7% from its 2023 high of $2,129 set in mid-April and 66% up from January 1, when the price was $1,197. 

TRON experienced the most growth this week and was the only top thirty cryptocurrency to grow by 8% over the week to trade at $0.070261 at the start of the weekend. 

All other leading cryptocurrencies remain virtually unmoved over the last seven days. 

The market’s lack of growth this week is at least partly attributable to the Fed’s decision to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points to fight inflation, the tenth consecutive hike since March last year. 

In macroeconomic terms, interest rate hikes tend to drive investors away from risk-on assets like stocks and crypto as the cost of borrowing rises, making money more expensive and thus discouraging more speculative investments. 

On Tuesday the White House released a report reinforcing the idea of a Digital Asset Mining Energy tax (DAME). It would apply to miners of both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, despite their different levels of energy consumption, and—beginning in 2024— assessing a tax that’s based on their electricity costs, starting at 10% and increasing each year until it reaches 30%. 

The proposal has already received heavy pushback from the crypto industry, especially because it doesn’t take into account the energy sources of the mining companies. Critics argue that the U.S. government is making a value judgment on crypto mining as a bad (or consumptive) activity regardless of whether a miner uses renewably-sourced energy or not. 

Presidential candidates and crypto

A 2024 Presidential hopeful for the Democrat party, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on Tuesday tweeted that he believes there is a top-down “war on crypto” that had something to do with the recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate and Signature. 

AD

Barely a month ago, Kennedy posted a long rant on Crypto Twitter railing against the idea of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency being released by the Federal Reserve. However, Kennedy’s thread was based on a misreading of an article about The Fed’s new digital payments system “FedNow,” which has nothing to do with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). 

Meanwhile, in the red corner, Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis—who is widely expected to run as a Presidential candidate next year—once more pushed back against CBDCs at a press conference on Tuesday titled ""Government of Laws, Not Woke Politics."" 

DeSantis aired a package of bills opposing ""'Environment, Social, and Governance"" or ESG policies. ESG policies evaluate factors beyond fiscal performance in evaluating a company or organization, such as environmental and community impact. One example is the White House’s DAME tax mentioned above.

DeSantis criticized the ESG approach as “virtue signaling” and tied the concept of a CBDC to ESG’s ""woke"" practices by saying that CBDC advocates ""will impose ESG and social credit scores onto that, and that's going to be a huge reduction in freedom for people in this country."" His words echoed his earlier remarks that a U.S. CBDC would be “Big Brother’s Digital Dollar.""

Finally, in adoption news, famed auction house Sotheby’s on Monday launched an on-chain NFT marketplace for secondary NFT sales, enabling collectors to list and make offers on work from artists. 

Argentine crypto fans fear they could be witnessing the start of a crypto crackdown, meanwhile. On Friday the country’s central bank banned payment platforms from offering crypto trading services to their customers.

"Gaming","Sui Is Built for Games—Here's Why Developers Are Bullish","Gaming","This story comes from GG.
Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up
Discover GG

Layer-1 blockchain network Sui has already positioned itself as one of the most appealing destinations for Web3 game developers—despite being the newest to the game so far.

Polygon, Immutable, Avalanche, and Solana have growing Web3 gaming ecosystems with a wide variety of games in all stages of development. But Sui, which just launched its mainnet on Wednesday, offers unique technical specifications and a different approach to on-chain assets that’s made it a compelling alternative for budding game makers.

AD

Part of what makes Sui unique is its ability to process transactions in parallel, as well as scale horizontally by adding more nodes to keep up with demand—two features designed to keep its transaction fees very low as more and more games and decentralized apps (dapps) come online. Dynamically-updated NFTs and an ""object-based"" model may also prove appealing to game designers, Sui creator Mysten Labs claims.

Sui is not Ethereum-compatible via the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which sets it apart from some of the established Web3 gaming networks out there, but Mysten believes that the network’s innate gaming appeal will allow it to onboard mainstream gamers.

Game-first approach

Mysten Labs’ Head of Gaming Partnerships Anthony Palma told Decrypt in an interview that over 40 games are building on Sui so far—even though the mainnet has only been live for a few days.

“Our mission is to go after not ‘blockchain games’ or ‘crypto games,’” Palma said, “but to go after great games built by great game developers that want to leverage Web3 to enhance their player experience, and provide more engagement and agency.”

The Sui NFT Scene Already Has Early Buzz—Will It Last?

Since the Sui blockchain’s mainnet launch on Wednesday, an active NFT community is already taking root, with marketplaces dropping projects that have sold out and collectively yielded hundreds of thousands’ of dollars worth of trades—albeit with some early hitches. The Mysten Labs-developed layer-1 blockchain has been billed a “Solana killer” by some, but Solana boasts one of the liveliest NFT markets around, second only to Ethereum.

Palma echoed a growing sentiment about Web3 games putting gameplay before any crypto elements—a take that leaders at firms like Magic Eden, Ava Labs, Solana Foundation, Gala Games, and others have expressed in recent months.

When it comes to Sui’s technical appeal, Palma shared that Sui is an “object-based” chain. Broadly, what that means is that the network is well-optimized for games, which consist of hundreds if not thousands of in-game objects created in game engines like Unreal Engine 5 or Unity.

 

AD

Palma believes that Sui allows game developers to more easily and seamlessly evolve in-game asset NFTs over time, because Sui’s on-chain assets can change dynamically in real-time as players are leveling up items like a sword, for example.

Evolving game assets

Rival player kills and achievements secured with specific items can be added to that item’s metadata—or the data that describes the unique attributes of an NFT—automatically, allowing players to “write” their own histories with each item as they play.

“If somebody sees there's a sword with 10,000 kills, versus the same sword with 100 kills, the 10,000-kill sword is just gonna inherently carry more value,” Palma argued.

“But it also allows you to do things like upgrading the NFT based on its metadata,” he continued. “You could do something like have a sword go from ‘gold’ to ‘legendary’ to ‘mythic,’ if you have a system like that.""

Abyss World. Image: Metagame Industries / Steam.

Such dynamic items are possible on Sui without having to burn and reissue items to reflect the new data, as developers might on other blockchain networks. When tokens are burned and re-minted on other chains, their histories are typically lost unless developers make a point of manually adding an item’s previous data to the new one.

“If you wanted to do this on another chain, you would either be doing a ton of syncing between your central database—where this info usually exists—and the on-chain transaction history,” Palma said, “or you would be burning the NFTs and re-minting new ones to go from 'gold' to 'mythic.'""

“Sui’s dynamic model allows you to keep all of that provenance, which should drive the value of these items over time—both for players and for the ecosystem,” he added. “So it's just a really cool new feature that you can bake into your games that wasn't really possible on-chain before.”

Sui developers speak

Mysten Labs has been working closely with game developers—the startup behind Sui won’t be taking a hands-off approach, said Palma. Over the next month, numerous games will launch on Sui, including a ""Walking Dead"" game and Final Stardust from Orange Comet, Project Eluune from Arrivant, and Run Legends from Talofa Games, as well as metaverse game Worlds Beyond plus the Overwatch-esque Bushi.

But what do game developers building on Sui think about the network, and what’s drawn them to build on it? 

Ghost Ivy, a Web3 game studio building a first-person shooter (FPS) game called Haven’s Compass for PC and mobile, chose Sui because of its “usability” for gaming.

AD

“It was a hard decision,” Ghost Ivy CEO Fares Alu-Taleb told Decrypt about choosing Sui. “For us, it’s important that the game can stay online nonstop, and that the players won’t need any interaction with the blockchain. Sui makes this easier for us as developers.”

Abyss World is another Web3 game in development from Metagame Industries that will leverage Sui in a number of ways. Its developers want Abyss World to be a high-end, “AAA” role-playing game (RPG) that offers both player vs. player (PVP) and player vs. environment (PVE) game experiences, as well as an auto-battler mode through cloud gaming—which means the game can be played on either a phone or PC without having to download any files.

There will be in-game items that can be earned on-chain through gameplay in Abyss World, as well as via in-game “minting factories” where players can put existing items on-chain.

“The transaction speed is super fast,” Metagame President Kinson Hou told Decrypt about Sui. “I think it’s one of the only blockchains that can go to the internet’s scale.”

Abyss World also wants players to be able to launch their own private servers. Hou sees that as an important part of its community-driven model, in which all game events impact other players and gamers get to create a collective “player-driven history” in a singular timeline.

“We want to build the infinite game,” Hou said.

"Technology","AI Deepfakes Just Got Better With This Upgrade","Technology","MidJourney was already one of the most impressive AI image generators out there, and with the release of version 5.1, it's now become much more powerful. The algorithm update means that, even for beginners, it's now incredibly easy to create stunning works of art with minimal effort—and deepfakes. Lots and lots of deepfakes.

The AI image generator entered the public consciousness last month after deepfake images of Pope Francis in a white puffer coat went viral. The controversy sparked conversations about the ethics of AI generators like MidJourney, and the company took action soon after.

AD

Use of the word ""pope"" on MidJourney is now banned, but creating deepfakes of other people, such as President Joe Biden, is still allowed—probably until we see a viral image of Biden wearing a pink neon spandex jumpsuit doing yoga in the Oval Office.

Or maybe one of Biden wearing an intergalactic spartan costume that looks kinda like Iron Man.

Joe Biden as an intergalactic spartan, created with MidJourney.

MidJourney also allows users to create high-quality deepfakes using photos as a reference. This feature has significantly increased MidJourney's popularity due to the impressive results it provides and its low learning curve. At the moment, it is the most popular AI image model in terms of user interest, surpassing Dall-e and Stable Diffusion.

The latest upgrade to MidJourney promises improvements in the way the algorithm interprets users’ prompts. Version 5.0 was released just three months ago and marked a significant departure from Version 4.

This new model offers higher coherence, more accuracy to text prompts, fewer unwanted borders or text artifacts (the weird random things that sometimes appear on images), and sharper results overall, according to MidJourney. The icing on the cake is that the new version was trained to be more ""opinionated.""

Being opinionated means that the model has the freedom to be more creative when interpreting a user's prompt. This results in better images with basic prompts—even with absurd commands of just one or two words.

AD

For example, simply comparing the results for ""Bitcoin Wallet"" prompts using version 5.1 and 5.0 demonstrates the differences and improvements. Version 5.1 imagines a leather wallet, with a bitcoin logo embroidered and placed on a table. Version 5 simply shows a Wallet with a Bitcoin on a plain surface.

The new version further emphasizes the strengths that have led to MidJourney's explosion, without forgetting experienced users who now have a RAW mode if they want more accurate and less ""opinionated"" results.

And what about the many-fingered hands? MidJourney v5.1 has greatly improved. Hand representations are now successful in most cases, although the generator still produces some errors.

The MidJourney team says we might see version 5.2 in the future, further enhancing the capabilities of this tool. If third time's the charm, then the days of AI generators messing up hands in our favorite deepfakes may finally be behind us.

"Artificial Intelligence","​​AI Invasion: Hollywood Writers Strike to Save Your Netflix From Robot Takeover","Artificial Intelligence","At the heart of the latest writers' strike is a small clause revolving around the use of artificial intelligence.

Specifically, preventing the machines from writing any “literary material.” And as of Monday, studios have rejected the proposal, per the Writers Guild of America West (WGA).

AD

The WGA is one of the largest unions in the world of entertainment, acting on behalf of writers across the United States.

Since the start of the month, over 11,500 writers have traded their pens for picket signs as WGA attempted negotiations to maintain writers rooms, guaranteed employment length, improved residuals amid the rise of streaming services, and, of course, curtailing the use of AI in the industry.

“We’re fighting to stop the streamers and the studios from turning writing from a career into a gig job,” said comedian and writer Adam Conover on the strike’s first day. “They’re trying to take away our jobs and employ us one day a week like we’re Uber drivers. We’re fighting for fairness.”

The strike also takes aim at the rise of artificial intelligence, asking for safeguards against the use of AI in generating content.

The WGA's conditions demand studios “regulate [the] use of artificial intelligence on MBA-covered projects: AI can’t write or rewrite literary material; can’t be used as source material; and MBA-covered material can’t be used to train AI.”

An MBA refers to the minimum bargaining agreement, which covers the benefits and rights of writers within the WGA.

AD

Per the public negotiations, studios have rejected the proposal and countered “by offering annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”

Regulate AI 'before it’s too late’

The legal implications of AI in the entertainment industry add another layer of complexity.

Leigh Brecheen, a Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney at the firm Brecheen, Feldman, Breimer, Silver & Thompson LLP, called it “both a minefield and a new frontier.”

“The legal system isn't designed with AI in mind. For example, you cannot copyright a work that isn't written by a human,” she told Decrypt. “This raises lots of questions about how precious IP can be protected and when the threshold of human vs, AI creation is passed.”

It's easy to forget how rapidly this technology is improving, too. While many scoff at the possibility of AI fully replacing writers, the truth is, no one really seems to know how this will unfold.

The head of the same Hollywood law firm Richard Thompson went as far as asking if the WGA would ever accept an AI as a member of the union.

""I don’t think that will ever happen, but it makes my head spin to think about how it could work and what it might mean,” he told Decrypt. “There is a real risk that in a few years, you won’t need the humans.”

Defining which terms AI should be used are key, said Thompson, lest it becomes “too late.”

While the allure of AI technology is undeniable, it's essential to remember that ultimately, it's human lives that are affected.

“The greatest challenge for all of us is to find ways to retain our humanity. We cannot let ourselves become slaves to any technology or ideology,” he said. “If we focus on human flourishing as our touchstone, we have a chance of getting through these challenges to a better world on the other side.""

"DeFi","Ethereum Staking Deposits Outpace Withdrawals by $189M in ETH","DeFi","Decrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)

With Ethereum’s historic Shanghai upgrade completed and the dust (more or less) settled, it's time to revisit some of the key staking takeaways.

AD

The Shanghai upgrade allowed Ethereum stakers to finally withdraw their funds from the mainnet. Some had been waiting to do so since the staking feature was first introduced in December 2020.

Perhaps the most important development revealed by the event is that Kraken U.S. staking customers appear to have been more or less flushed from the system.

This is because of regulatory action taken against the crypto exchange, which saw it settle with the SEC for $30 million and shutter its staking operations for Americans back in February.

There’s still a sliver waiting to exit, but this bearish player has mostly been removed from the system.

Total Ethereum withdrawn by entity, including rewards since the upgrade was executed. Source: Nansen.

In terms of entities still waiting to withdraw staked funds, Coinbase is by far the largest, with more than 55,000 ETH primed to exit.

The next most important discovery here is that the net amount of Ethereum being staked is positive, indicating that there are more addresses depositing their Ethereum than there are withdrawing.

As of today, the figure is 97,586 ETH or $189 million at today’s prices.

This suggests that folks are still pretty bullish on staking with Ethereum and scooping up that extra ETH-denominated yield for doing so.

Some analysts indicate that this is also good for the asset because all this Ethereum getting locked up for staking needs means less ETH getting sold on the open market.

Finally, diving deeper, the upgrade continues to be a huge boost for liquid staking leaders Lido Finance.

Liquid staking refers to depositing your Ethereum in a protocol that then stakes that ETH on your behalf. In return, you get another token representing your staked position that also accumulates rewards. Lido’s token is called stETH and Coinbase’s equivalent is called cbETH.

Per Nansen, Lido’s staked ETH commands 79% of the total market of entities measured, hosting a whopping 6 million Ethereum. Second place goes to Coinbase, with about 15% of that market.

Afterwards, the public sale began with a Dutch auction format, with the initial price of 300 SUI (about $395) gradually dropping, hitting 150 SUI (nearly $200) before selling out.

Buyers who hoped to flip the Fuddies NFTs for a quick profit were quickly frustrated, however, when Clutchy’s secondary marketplace failed to work as intended.

Some Ethereum and Solana NFT collectors took the opportunity to call out the new rival’s marketplace for encountering technical difficulties. Clutchy had already delayed its planned Wednesday NFT mints after facing issues after the Sui mainnet launch.

Before long, however, the secondary marketplace started working—and so far, Clutchy reports some 605,000 SUI (about $792,500) worth of trading for Fuddies in about 24 hours. As the project creators noted on Twitter, that’s more than the total amount of NFT trading seen on Ethereum scaling network Polygon during the same span, per data from CryptoSlam.

It’s far and away the biggest NFT project on Sui so far, however. Another NFT project that minted on Clutchy yesterday and sold out, the sushi-themed Suishi, has only notched about 10,900 SUI (about $14,300) worth of secondary trades since the mint.

AD

Clutchy isn’t the only Sui NFT marketplace that’s live, however. Souffl3, a marketplace that started life on Aptos last fall, has expanded to Sui as well—but its top project so far hasn’t been a sales sensation. The biggest Sui project on Souffl3 is Sui Trident, which has stacked up just under $65,000 worth of trades in the last 24 hours.

Projects are launching and selling out, however, with drops like Fuddies and Suishi both selling through on Clutchy, and Depthos and Sui G00dies selling through. On the downside, however, the current price floor—that is, the price of the cheapest-listed NFT in the project—has fallen below the public mint price, to 118 SUI (about $155).

Ahead of the mainnet launch, Clutchy founder and CEO Jacob “Dizzy Lizzy” Lawless told Decrypt that the marketplace had seen “tons of interest from influencers, investors, creators and onlookers.”

Given the gold rush seen on Ethereum, Solana, and recently with Bitcoin Ordinals when the earliest NFTs on each platform shot up in value, there’s always an eagerness among creators to be first out the gate with projects on a new chain. Likewise, savvy collectors try to snatch up assets that will have early provenance, which could boost its value in the future.

We saw that most recently with the debut of Aptos last October, which saw a surge in trading volume that corresponded with a dip in Solana NFT sales. Like Sui, Aptos is built around the Move programming language, so there are commonalities—and it helps explain why Souffl3, for example, bridged over to Sui and bills itself as the “NFT market on Move.”

Aptos NFT fever calmed quickly, but the initial buzz was massive. The Aptos Monkeys NFT project, for example, yielded about $2.3 million worth of trading volume in about 24 hours in October, just over a week after the Aptos mainnet went live. Sui has yet to match that kind of peak, but it’s only been a couple of days since the mainnet rollout.

Amongst Sui creators, there’s excitement over the chain’s ability to enable more advanced capabilities than some other chains, such as dynamic NFTs that update in real time. There’s an obvious benefit for blockchain-based video games, for example, with weapons or armor that improve over time, potentially becoming more useful or valuable in the process.

And gaming may ultimately prove to be one of the biggest drivers of NFT momentum on Sui, with a slate of notable early titles like the Overwatch-esque hero shooter Bushi, a Walking Dead game, and tank game Panzerdogs (a Solana transplant) due out in the coming weeks.

“I feel like there's still a lot of interesting experimentation going on, culminating in another wave of NFT and dapp innovation,” pseudonymous Web3 project advisor Dabblerer told Decrypt. “The launches are inspired by lessons learned by early movers with some different takes.”

She pointed to other potential NFT use cases on the horizon for Sui, including a project called Sui Name Service (SuiNS). It’s similar in approach to the popular Ethereum Name Service (ENS), but with domain names tied both to NFTs as well as smart contracts (which hold the code that powers decentralized apps), which Dabblerer suggested would let users “interact with more trust and security.”

AD

“One of the main reasons we decided to build on Sui [is] because its tech provides a platform for innovation,” Clutchy’s Lawless said. He added that the Move language “significantly lowers the boundaries for creators to innovate through dynamic NFTs,” potentially unlocking more types of use cases and compelling apps and experiences.

Just a couple days into the Sui mainnet launch, however, such innovative projects and applications could still be far off on the horizon. For now, the projects launching this week mostly look and feel like derivative knockoffs of collections on other chains.

Still, a small but engaged community flipping hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of PFPs is something—and we’ll see whether the early buzz grows into something that can put a real scare into competing NFT ecosystems.

In a Friday filing, Voyager said that a number of digital assets on the platform that cannot be withdrawn will be liquidated and returned to customers. They include major cryptocurrencies like Algorand (ALGO), Celo (CELO), and Avalanche (AVAX). 

AD

A number of other major cryptocurrencies on the platform will not be liquidated but returned to customers in digital form, albeit at a recovery rate of about 36%, according to the court filing. These include major crypto assets Aave (AAVE), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and 65 others. 

Former customers will receive some form of reimbursement soon, the failed firm said on Twitter. “We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks,” it wrote. 

Binance US, the sister company of crypto exchange Binance that claims to be run independently, walked away from a $1.3 billion restructuring deal to buy Voyager assets last week. It cited a “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

Digital asset broker Voyager blew up last year after revealing it had massive exposure to failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.

The firm has since been working out how to return assets to investors who used its services. Crypto exchange FTX was planning to buy Voyager’s distressed assets—but then itself went bankrupt in a highly-publicized and unexpected collapse which rocked the crypto ecosystem.

Its founder and ex-boss Sam Bankman-Fried has since been hit with 13 criminal charges and is awaiting trial.

Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up
Discover GG

Gala Games is rolling out an upgraded GALA token on May 15 via an airdrop to existing holders—but major exchange Coinbase says that it won’t support the Web3 gaming startup's move.

Coinbase announced this week that it will disable trading on May 12 for the GALA token (Gala V1) and will not let holders receive the new airdropped token (V2), nor does it currently plan to provide any way to swap the tokens after the fact.

AD

Holders on Coinbase will still be able to withdraw their V1 tokens to a self-custodied or hardware wallet after the V2 token goes live, but they won’t be able to do much else with those V1 assets after the May 15 drop. In order for Coinbase users to convert their old Gala tokens, they’ll have to move their Gala V1 to a wallet before May 15 and wait to receive the new token.

Gala has advised holders who have Gala V1 in a liquidity pool or held in smart contracts to withdraw their tokens in order to ensure receipt of the new token. After May 15, Gala V1 will have “no support or usability,"" the firm said.

Why is this happening? From Gala’s perspective, the token upgrade was an important and necessary step for the cryptocurrency. The new token’s smart contract—which contains the code that powers things like tokens, NFT projects, and decentralized apps—will offer “enhanced burn mechanisms, security enhancements, and future upgradeability,” according to a Gala blog post.

Gala v2 Airdrop Announced: What You Need to Know

Web3 gaming project Gala Games will airdrop GALA v2 tokens to all GALA holders on May 15, the team announced in a blog post. An automatic 1:1 conversion for all users has been arranged, with support for the GALA v1 token being immediately dropped. No action is required from users holding GALA in their Ethereum wallet(s). The team has advised users to remove their GALA tokens from any liquidity pools or smart contracts before the snapshot on May 15; if tokens are left in a liquidity pool, the liq...

Gala Games’ President of Blockchain Jason Brink explained on Twitter that Gala’s token has evolved over the years, first existing as an Ethereum ERC-1155 token which then had to be reissued via the ERC-20 token standard when the team decided that it needed to improve its capabilities.

“As time has moved forward, we have identified other improvements that can be made to that token,” Brink said of the ERC-20 token, Gala V1. “Unfortunately, that isn't how the original contract works and it cannot be upgraded. The only solution is to do what we did the first time—deprecate the old contract and token, deploy a new contract, and use that instead.”

Brink wrote that he’s unsure why Coinbase won’t be supporting Gala’s new iteration, but he suspects that it is due to the issuance method appearing like an ""airdrop"" of bonus tokens rather than replacement ones.

AD

Brink argued that Gala’s V2 issuance isn’t a traditional airdrop, per se, because Gala isn’t trying to give its holders freebies or extra goodies for owning their old token. Instead, Gala said that it’s simply doing what has to be done to upgrade the contract. In this case, it consists of moving to a new smart contract and sending Gala V1 holders the identical amount of tokens through the new Gala V2 contract.

The Gala V2 release is technically an airdrop, as tokens will automatically be sent to self-custody wallets holding the V1 tokens, although Gala has refrained from using that particular terminology. Gala's blog post about the launch refers to it as a ""drop"" (not ""airdrop""), while Brink used the term ""deployment"" in his tweet thread.

When Decrypt asked Coinbase via email why it’s not supporting Gala V2, a representative said that the exchange had “nothing to add,” and pointed to its published tweet thread. But the thread doesn't offer a clear explanation of why.

Brink remains optimistic that Coinbase will ultimately reconsider following the Web3 gaming startup’s additional explanation of its approach.

“It is my hope that once there is a little bit of clarity, they will decide to support the V2 token,” Brink added.

While Coinbase just reported a 22% revenue bump compared to the previous quarter, the exchange is still facing a number of regulatory and legal challenges. Coinbase’s caution around token issuance comes as the exchange faces increased regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The exchange announced this week that it is shutting down its “Bitcoin Borrow” lending service, which it claims is unrelated to its SEC battle. Coinbase was also sued this week for allegedly violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act due to its collection of user data, plus an ex-Coinbase product manager pleaded guilty to criminal charges of insider trading earlier this year.

In a Wall Street Journal exclusive, Dan Sung-han, head of the South Korean team investigating the crime, said: “Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice” to investors.

According to Sung-han, who is backed by two decades of experience, most of the key evidence and accomplices linked to Do Kwon are based in South Korea. He’s said that the launch and failure of both cryptocurrencies constitute a “systemic crime.”

Do Kwon and his collaborators face charges for fraud, violations of capital-markets laws, using “trader bots” to manipulate transaction volumes, bribery and a series of other financial crimes.

Authorities from the Southeast Asian nation have been investigating individuals involved in the collapse for nearly 10 months, leading up to the recent indictments. If found guilty, Do Kwon would likely face the longest jail term for a financial crime in the country’s history, says Sung-han.

"Business","Argentina Bans Payment Apps From Offering Bitcoin to Customers","Business","Argentina’s central bank is clamping down on crypto. In a statement yesterday, the bank said that payment platforms are now banned from offering digital assets like Bitcoin to customers. 

The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) said that the reason was to “mitigate risks.”

AD

A number of popular companies—including fintech giant Ualá and online marketplace Mercado Libre—offer clients crypto trading. 

“Payment service providers that offer payment accounts may not carry out or facilitate transactions with digital assets, including cryptoassets, that are not regulated by the competent national authority and authorized by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) to their customers,” the Thursday statement said. 

The bank did not expand on why, other than to protect customers, in the announcement. 

It now means that major platforms, including Mercado Libre, Latin America’s answer to Amazon, will no longer be able to offer Argentinians Bitcoin buying services. 

Argentina—Latin America’s third largest economy—right now suffers from one of the worst inflation rates in the world: It soared past 100% last month for the first time in three decades. 

A number of crypto startups in the country and even one popular presidential candidate have preached the use of Bitcoin as a savior for ordinary Argentinians who cannot save or are being pushed into poverty because of the collapse of the peso.

"Technology","Developer Inserts 'Bug' in Bitcoin Ordinals—How Bad Is It?","Technology","There’s fresh controversy brewing in the Bitcoin Ordinals community after a developer under the moniker “Supertestnet” initiated a transaction that had no input or output, but is nevertheless seen as valid.

This resulted in the Ordinals’s inscription numbering system crashing, sparking concerns that the whole protocol may now be broken.

AD

Ordinal inscriptions, also known as ""proof of ownership"" inscriptions, are essentially a way of attaching metadata to a specific Bitcoin transaction.

This metadata can include information about the digital asset being transferred, such as its title, description, and ownership details. So far, it's also been used for a wide array of on-chain media inscriptions including artwork, profile pictures, playable games, and video-based web apps.

Unlike Ethereum-based NFTs, which require the use of a separate token and smart contract to record ownership and transfer of digital assets, Ordinal inscriptions are recorded directly on the Bitcoin blockchain without the need for a sidechain or separate token.

The transaction in question, which did not include any satoshis (smallest unit of BTC), was found in block 788200.

“[The Ordinals protocol] validated the inscription (3492721) attached to the input, which sounds like a bug,” Ludo Galabru, staff engineer at Hiro Systems commented on the issue on GitHub. “Philosophically, the satoshi inscribed was transferred to the miner as a transaction fee, but was nevertheless inscribed by its previous owner.”

The Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor agreed that “it shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own,” suggesting the transaction is indeed a bug.

“However, fixing the bug by making [the Ordinals protocol] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” added Rodarmor soon after the issue was found.

But is there an actual danger for the Ordinals protocol?

AD
Bitcoin Ordinals under scrutiny

According to Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy, the bug doesn’t pose any risk to the Ordinals protocol itself.

“Personally, I think this is totally fine. In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway,” Diekroeger tweeted on Friday.

Supertestnet agreed that there’s no immediate danger to the protocol itself, although he is “not sure not sure what long-term consequences will be.”

“The short-term consequence was that the guys who were running indexing software had to fix the bug,” Supertestnet told Decrypt.

What actually happened and what prompted the Austin-based developer to run such an experiment, which Diekroeger described as “the first valiant attack on ordinal inscriptions?”

According to Supertestnet, it all started during a recent conference in Austin, where a hackathon was held and people were supposed to be coming up with projects, and the idea was born to try to make “some weird thing in Bitcoin and create a transaction that sends somebody zero Satoshis.”

“No one at the conference wanted to do that project, so I did something else. But afterward, I tried it and created one of these weird transactions and broadcasted it to a miner who mined it for me,” Supertestnet told Decrypt.

Calling himself the “breaker of jpegs,” Supertestnet not only inserted this bug into Ordinal explorers but also created a tool that lets other users increase the attack.

AD

Yet, he also admitted that “it’s not entirely clear to me exactly what's happening right now.”

“Normally, when you create an inscription, you have to create a Bitcoin address that has some satoshis in it. And then you create an image that the software assigns to one of the satoshis in your Bitcoin address. But my Bitcoin address had zero satoshis in it. So it seems that it assigned it a negative number, which is weird by itself,” explained Supertestnet.

Despite that, when the software encountered this negative number it appears to have tried to give this inscription a number.

“It took that and then either made it the first satoshi in the block, which then belongs to the miner, or it put it in the previous transaction’s transaction fee, which then went to the miner. Either way, it definitely went to the miner like that's the inscription,"" Supertestnet said. ""But that's not supposed to happen. You're not supposed to be able to inscribe somebody else's satoshis without their consent. So that's like a bug.""

Things are “a little more complicated” for Ordinals explorers, according to the developer, because all the numbers after his inscription are off by one.

“If they decide to fix that, they will have to undo all the numbers that have been issued since then, like decrementing them all by one or by however many they're off by one now. But they might not fix it, or they may fix it for the future but all the previous ones are going to remain like they are.”

“I don't know what they'll do, maybe they’ll decide that it’s not important anymore and that it’s not the bug but a feature,” added Supertestnet.

The company reeled in $736 million in revenue in the first three months of the year—a 22% boost from the previous quarter—while also decreasing operating expenses by 24% within that time.

AD

This was in line with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s decision in early January to cut the exchange’s headcount by 950 people. 

The value of assets on Coinbase’s platform also underwent a massive 62% surge to $130 billion this quarter, assisted by Bitcoin’s surge 72% surge from the beginning to the end of Q1. 

“We’ve been focused on building an increasingly efficient business that can do more for less,” stated Coinbase after releasing its earnings report on Thursday. ""We reduced costs, doubled down on operational excellence and risk management, while continuing to drive product innovation and regulatory clarity.”

COIN was hammered throughout all of 2022 amid a combination of macroeconomic headwinds and a tanking crypto market, and is still down roughly 83% from its 2021 highs. The firm has since been targeted with a Wells Notice by the Securities and Exchange Commission signaling an intention to sue for potential violation of securities laws.

The exchange refuses to back down, however, clapping back with its own lawsuit to force the regulatory agency to clarify crypto regulations last month. The company is also preparing to potentially move its headquarters outside the US if regulatory challenges in the region persist – potentially to the United Kingdom.

Cryptocurrencies are often billed as part of a permissionless ecosystem, where blockchains are open and anyone can create a token. And as a result, one could say that passing judgment on whether or not a coin is dangerous for investors goes against the ideals of Web3.

The glorification of risky trades is not isolated to remote corners of crypto, either. Prominent communities like Reddit’s Wall Street Bets have taken a similar YOLO approach to stock trading for years. But decentralized finance, or DeFi, has bolstered the meme coin scene in recent years.

There may be a new meme coin every minute, but meme coins as a category aren't new. Launched in 2013 as a joke, Dogecoin was one of the first notable examples, and it has since achieved a market cap of nearly $11 billion, as of this writing, according to CoinGecko.

Its success has opened the door to a cadre of canine-themed coins, whether that’s tokens like Shiba Inu or, more recently, Bonk. And though Pepe is an amphibious phenomenon, it shares similar characteristics with other meme coins, writes Lim Yu Qian of CoinGecko.

“Meme coins are a very risky type of crypto because they are based on Internet cultural references,” she wrote Thursday. “The price movement depends on whether the meme coins can stay relevant by driving hype.”

Of the 179 meme coins tracked by CoinGecko, Qian notes that Pepe is one of the only meme coins to break into the top 100 by market capitalization, aside from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. And Pepe is on a tear, for now, up over 2,900% over the past 17 days, according to CoinGecko.

AD

The sense of hype surrounding Pepe is undeniable. DeAndre Cortez Way, more commonly known as the rapper Soulja Boy, is gleefully contributing to Pepe’s exposure. “I done got rich off #PEPE,” he Tweeted on Wednesday.

It’s worth noting that Way is just one of several personalities on Twitter giving Pepe the thumbs up. However, there are some digital asset veterans who advocate a cautious approach toward meme coins.

Thomas Kralow, the founder of University Grade Trading Education, told Decrypt that meme coin mania reminded him of a quote from the mathematician Isaac Newton: “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people.”

Kralow said he would never recommend investing in them, arguing that meme coins have nothing to support their price once the sense of “hype dies out,” often leaving their value attached to lackluster utility.

“It’s not a very sound investment, it’s just gambling,” he said. “Those who invested in Pepe Coin were lucky that it picked up, while there [are] thousands of others that didn’t.”

The cautious sentiment toward meme coins was echoed by Chen Arad, COO and a co-founder of Solidus Labs, which last year acquired Token Sniffer, a tool that scans smart contracts for scams. He told Decrypt that hype, buzz, and FOMO are often conducive to fraud and price manipulation.

“If you make the right bet at the right time, you could theoretically make high gains, but buzz and FOMO are a scammer's best friend, since they push investors to make rash decisions,” he said. “We suggest a high degree of cautions when considering investing in meme coins.”

"NFTs","You Can Mint a Free Ethereum NFT for King Charles’ Coronation","NFTs","Hear ye, hear ye! Just in time for the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on May 6, the Evening Standard newspaper has teamed with digital artist Trevor Jones to launch a free collection of commemorative Ethereum NFT celebrating the event on Nifty Gateway.

Created in collaboration with Apollo NFT, “The Oath” can be claimed directly on Nifty Gateway or by using a QR code printed in the newspaper. The QR codes are also posted on billboards along Oxford Street, for those travelling to the capital to take part in the celebrations in person. But before you let the FOMO set in, the NFTs won’t be minted and delivered to collectors' wallets until May 7.

AD

“With the eyes of the world on London this weekend, we are extremely proud to collaborate with Trevor Jones and celebrate this iconic moment for our city,” Evening Standard CEO Charles Yardley said. “Trevor’s NFT depicts imagery representing centuries of tradition and history, in a format that represents how the modern world is democratising art for both artists and collectors.”

The Oath NFT began as a physical painting by Jones in his Edinburgh studio. The artwork depicts Saint Edward’s Crown, worn by Queen Elizabeth II in her 1953 coronation.

“With Layer-2 in play now and the carbon footprint down 99.99%, there’s no longer an environmental issue with using the Ethereum blockchain,” Jones told Decrypt. “More importantly, however, I saw this as a fantastic opportunity to onboard new collectors into the NFT art scene, which is currently hitting quite the lows from the last couple of years.”

Layer-2 refers to a protocol built on a blockchain like Immuntable X or the Bitcoin Lightning Network.

“Dropping on Nifty Gateway meant that anyone could register an account simply with an email address and mint their first NFT artwork,” Jones said, adding that he wanted the process to be as simple as possible for collectors minting their first NFT.

The Evening Standard joins other media outlets making the leap into Web3, including TIME, GQ, and Playboy.

The Oath isn't the first NFT mint to commemorate the British royal family. In September, following the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, an NFT collection, QueenE by Web3 builders Fabio Sevá, Vinícius Rodrigues, Everton Matumoto, and the pseudonymous mladen.eth, was launched to celebrate the life of England’s longest (1952-2022) reigning monarch.

AD

Non-fungible tokens, NFTs, are cryptographically unique tokens linked to digital and physical content, providing proof of ownership, authenticity, or membership in a group. Previous collections by Jones include Bitcoin Angels, Man vs. Machine with rap icon Ice Cube, and Picasso’s Bull.

"Business","Jack Dorsey’s Cash App Posts $2.16B in Bitcoin Revenue for Q1 2023","Business","Thanks to an increase in the amount of Bitcoin sold to its customers, Block’s Cash App generated $50 million of Bitcoin gross profit in the first quarter of 2023, up 16% year-over-year, the company said in a shareholder letter Thursday.

The total sale amount of Bitcoin sold to customers, which Block said it recognizes as Bitcoin revenue, was $2.16 billion, up 25% year-over-year.

AD

In its previous earnings report Block reported $1.83 billion in Bitcoin revenue from the Cash App business.

According to the company, “the year-over-year increase in Bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of Bitcoin compared to the prior-year period.”

Block, formerly known as Square, is a payments company founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. It serves small and medium businesses, with mobile payment service Cash App being a popular tool for buying and selling Bitcoin, especially for younger users and those who prefer to conduct financial transactions on their mobile devices.

With Cash App, users can link their bank accounts, credit cards, or debit cards to their account and use the app to send or receive payments from other users. Cash App also offers a range of other features, including the ability to invest in stocks, and a debit card that allows users to spend their Cash App balance at retailers and withdraw cash from ATMs.

In October 2022, Block announced full support for Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s second layer scalability solution that enables users to conduct fast and low-cost transactions off-chain, while still enjoying the security and trustlessness of the network.

No impairment loss on Bitcoin holdings, says Block

In its latest earnings report the company also revealed it did not post an impairment loss on its Bitcoin holdings in Q1 after investing a total of $220 million in the leading cryptocurrency in the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021. Back then, Block purchased $50 million and $170 million worth of Bitcoin, respectively.

As explained by Block, Bitcoin as an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subject to impairment losses if its fair value decreases below the carrying value during the assessed period.

As of March 31, 2023, the fair value of the company’s investment in Bitcoin was $229 million, or “$126 million greater than the carrying value of the investment after cumulative impairment charges.”

AD

“The accounting rules for Bitcoin currently require us to recognize any decreases in market price below carrying value as an impairment charge, with no upward revisions recognized when the market price increases until the sale of that Bitcoin,” said the company, adding that it revalues its Bitcoin holdings on a daily basis using the closing price at midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Block’s shares (SQ) changed hands at $60.43 at the closing bell on Thursday, up 1.87% over the day, jumping almost 5% to $63.35 in Friday’s pre-market trades.

"Technology","PEPE Meme Coin Hysteria Pushes Ethereum Gas Fees to 1-Year High","Technology","Ethereum’s gas fees have surged above a one-year high as the demand for trading the PEPE meme coin continues to soar.

The average cost of a single transaction on Ethereum jumped above $15.82 on May 4.

AD

While Ethereum’s mean transaction fees have reached much higher levels of between $50 to $70 in 2021, things have been quiet since the market crashed in May 2022.

Daily median gas price. Source: Etherscan.

It’s likely that excitement around meme coins, specifically the newly-launched PEPE, is responsible for the revival in gas fees.

In the last 24 hours, the trading volume for PEPE surpassed $150 million on Uniswap, higher than Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and USDT stablecoin volumes.

The PEPE token also entered the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on May 1, obtaining a valuation of over $500 million. The token has continued to surge since then, last trading at a market value of $879 million.

Following the success of PEPE coin, numerous copycats have also emerged representing different internet memes.

Data from crypto analytics firm Nansen shows that the most active smart contracts on Ethereum are currently Uniswap trading pools for meme coins such as SPONGE, TURBO, BOB, and TRBNR.

The increased gas fees witnessed 9,392 in ETH burned over the last 24 hours, at par with one-year high levels.

Ethereum executed a hard fork in 2021 which meant that a portion of all Ethereum transactions were destroyed. Thus, as activity increases on the network, more ETH is destroyed.

AD

The rise in Ethereum’s transaction fees has led to a rise in gas fees for Layer-2 transactions as well.

Are Ethereum scaling solutions helping?

The gas fees for layer-2 transactions have also surged with mainnet fees as related data for layer-2 transactions are also posted in layer-1 blocks for security.

There are two kinds of layer-2 scaling solutions: zero-knowledge proofs and optimistic. Both use another technology called rollups, which batch transactions off of the mainnet into a single, smaller transaction before settling on the mainnet.

Notably, zero-knowledge proof (ZK)-based rollups were hit relatively worse than optimistic rollups. The fees for swapping tokens on ZK-based scaling solutions like Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, and zkSync Era mainnet surged between $2 to $11.

A zkSync Discord community member noted they had to pay $11 swap ETH to USDC, noting in amazement that “Is it gonna cost that much?”

Another user complained about $30 in fees for DeFi deposits on zkSync.

According to L2 Fees data, the gas fees for sending ETH on Arbitrum One and Optimism, both of which are Optimistic rollup solutions, are between $0.2 to $0.6 for swap tokens, which is around ten times higher than the mean value.

The recent surge in AI advancements—driven in large part by the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT program and subsequent developments—has propelled discussions on ethical and conscientious AI practices to the forefront of public discourse.

“AI is one of the most powerful technologies of our time, but in order to seize the opportunities it presents, we must first mitigate its risks,” the administration wrote in a statement.

“President Biden has been clear that when it comes to AI,” the statement continued, “we must place people and communities at the center by supporting responsible innovation that serves the public good while protecting our society, security, and economy.”

Recent advancements in AI technology have brought the conversation around ethical and responsible development of artificial intelligence into the mainstream, with several high-profile tech industry members calling in late March for a pause on development.

The White House’s announcement also includes a $140 million investment by the National Science Foundation to go towards ethical AI research and development, infrastructure, and workforce diversity.

The administration said that OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Stability AI have committed to an independent public evaluation of AI systems during annual hacker convention DEFCON's AI Village in Las Vegas, Nevada in August.

“The independent evaluation will provide valuable insights into the models’ impacts, helping developers address issues,” the White House wrote. Furthermore, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said that it will roll out draft policy guidance regarding the government’s own potential AI use ahead.

AD

Even though AI development is decades old, the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November and its latest GPT-4 large language model in March shifted the adoption of artificial intelligence into overdrive. Corporations and governments alike have struggled to keep pace with the technology, which has the potential to reshape industries far and wide.

Last October, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy introduced the blueprint for an “AI Bill of Rights” presenting five guiding principles for automated systems’ design, use, and deployment.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Hxro announced that a newly-formed studio, Bitblox Games, has been created to develop on-chain, player-versus-player (PvP) gambling games that leverage Hxro’s Solana-based platform.

In a blog post Thursday, Hxro said that Bitblox Games is where ""OG degens meet crypto degens,"" referring to the crypto slang term for risk-loving traders or “degenerates.” It has also appointed Hxro’s VP Business Development Brandt Page to serve as Bitblox Games’ CEO. 

AD

“Bitblox dramatically expands the scope of what igaming can be,” said Page in the announcement. “Blockchain-based gaming provides additional transparency to igaming operators while giving players the ability to bet in new and engaging ways.” 

The gambling and casino industry calls online gambling “igaming.” But unlike most video games, the vast majority of gambling games are not immersive worlds, do not feature well-developed characters (if they have any characters at all), and prioritize financial betting mechanics over other types of gameplay. 

Instead, the “igaming” industry offers its users flashy browser-based gambling experiences where thousands of dollars can be won or lost with the click of a button. 

Hxro co-founder Dan Gunsberg called on-chain gaming—where some elements of a game involve crypto transactions or data stored on a crypto network—a “surprisingly underserved subset” of the online gambling industry. 

“Bitblox will bring the online gambling industry into the Web3 era, supporting Hxro Network’s goal to be the world’s largest on-chain source of derivatives and igaming liquidity,” Gunsberg said in a statement. 

While the gambling industry may see its products as a form of gaming, a number of top video game streamers and livestreaming platforms like Twitch have taken strong stances against online gambling in recent months. Twitch called unregulated gambling sites “unsafe” in a blog post, and in October 2022, banned creators from livestreaming online gambling sites like Stake, which allows users to gamble with crypto.

""Fedi, as a company, aims to empower communities everywhere by accelerating the adoption of technologies like Bitcoin and Lightning—and rolling out Fedimint federations to communities and companies worldwide is how we intend to do it,"" Fedi CEO and co-founder Obi Nwosu told Decrypt.

AD

Fedimint federations are a cryptographic Bitcoin tool that allows users to set up communities—which could be made up of friends, neighbors, businesses, or any other loosely coupled group of people—for custodying Bitcoin and Lightning together.

Stepping back for a minute, Bitcoin stands out from traditional digital money because it allows users to have control of their assets, rather than trust them in the hands of a third party. It’s kind of like digital cash. But, most users end up storing their money on exchanges or custodial wallets anyway because self-custody takes time to learn.

Lightning Labs Aims to Help 'Bring Bitcoin to Billions' With Latest Upgrade

The team at Bitcoin tech startup Lightning Labs, one of the main developers of Bitcoin's speedy and scalable Lightning Network, released an update to its Litd node management tool designed to make Bitcoin and Lightning easier to use. Users need to run a Lightning “node” to send and receive payments on the network non-custodially, meaning without the assistance of a third party, a feat that isn’t easy for users who aren’t tech-savvy or don’t want to spend hours learning the ins and outs of the pr...

Fedi wants to use federations to provide a way of using Bitcoin that's easy, and gives users more security than traditional Bitcoin wallets. It works because rather than just one custodian being in charge, the Fedimint protocol allows power to be distributed amongst a number of custodians, making it harder for any single entity to run off with the funds.

""The main advantages of the Fedimint protocol are that it provides an incredibly powerful yet simple way to use Bitcoin without requiring a single point of trust or control, it allows Bitcoin to scale to billions of users, and it enables builders to extend the functionality of the Bitcoin ecosystem more powerfully and easily than current smart contract, DeFi, and Web3 solutions on alternative blockchains,"" Nwosu said.

Additionally, Fedi claims to provide more privacy than the most popular Bitcoin wallets. Under the hood, the Fedimint protocol obscures who's a part of a federation and how much Bitcoin each user has, so that the custodians can’t see any of these details.

Fedi also has plans to go beyond Bitcoin with a ""federated operating system"" that would allow ""a Fedi user to take control of their money and data by utilizing one or more trusted federations of their choosing,” Nwosu said.

""One of Fedi's in-built features will be a wallet, but chat, web browsing, and application execution will also be significant capabilities,"" he added. The team plans to release an Alpha version of its product geared towards developers by the end of the month.

The CFTC-regulated trading platform was one of the only FTX entities which remained solvent following FTX’s highly publicized Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last November.

FTX allowed people to buy, sell, and bet on the future price of digital assets. Its ex-boss and co-founder’s face was plastered on ads around San Francisco and appeared to be cozy with politicians—donating to both the Republicans and Democrats.

"NFTs","LACMA Ventures Deeper Into NFT Art With Experimental Deafbeef Collection","NFTs","The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) took a big step into the NFT world in February when it announced the acquisition of a valuable collection of tokenized artwork. But the famed art museum isn’t just collecting—it’s also working with noted Web3 creators to pay homage to classic art in new and experimental ways.

LACMA’s “Remembrance of Things Future” initiative continues this week with the launch of a pair of interactive NFT collections from noted pseudonymous artist Deafbeef, who uses a C code compiler to create distinctive work. His “Noumenon + Chronophotograph” Ethereum NFT project draws inspiration from the formative work of English photographer Eadweard Muybridge.

AD

The 19th-century photographer’s motion studies through chronological photo sequences—most famously “The Horse in Motion,” of a galloping horse—helped inform future film and animation, as well as other art styles. The sequences were famously referenced in Jordan Peele’s 2022 film, “Nope.”

“Remembrance of Things Future” is a collaboration between LACMA and blockchain consultancy Cactoid Labs. Like other participating artists, Deafbeef was given free rein to choose works from LACMA’s permanent collection and find something that resonated with him—and that he could respond to, artistically.

“All of the images really had an enigmatic quality to them that was familiar, but mysterious. They're part of our consciousness, because those images are really well known,” Deafbeef told Decrypt of Muybridge’s work. “I just found a wealth of interesting things and connections to really dive into.”

Eadweard Muybridge's ""Animal Locomotion"" (1886). Image: LACMA

The project centers on 16 “Noumenon” Ethereum NFTs, each a unique, minute-long animation derived from compiled C code. Deafbeef described each monochromatic audiovisual work as “representing unknowable reality beyond our immediate senses.”

“The qualities of it visually and sonically are meant to suggest that there are lilting rhythms and time distortion. It's amorphous and fading, and there’s different shapes,” he continued. “It’s meant to be sort of beyond your grasp.”

Go to video page

The eventual owner of each Noumenon can then take—or delegate another wallet to take—a chronophotograph still image sequence that’s turned into a separate NFT, thanks to the associated smart contract. A smart contract holds the code that powers NFT projects, and this one contains a unique “releaseShutter” function that can be called to generate the still snapshot.

A potentially endless number of chronophotographs can be taken from each Noumenon NFT, providing a stream of unique editions that could be kept or traded. But there's a catch: a time lock that exponentially expands, doubling after each snapshot. Interestingly, every subsequent chronophotograph is also a larger, clearer, and higher-resolution still sequence.

For Deafbeef, the project provided not only the opportunity to learn more about Muybridge’s work and discover the connections between them, but also to ruminate on concepts like “contrasting scales of time” and what constitutes a source of truth.

“There's this conception of photography being an objective measurement, but it has never been,” he said, noting the possibility of doctored shots and the influence of human framing. “People also have this narrative in crypto. There's this ethos that the blockchain is truth; it's a source of objective reference. But again, it has to be interpreted by humans.”

A total of 224 Chronophotograph NFTs were pre-minted, and those will be sold for 0.2 ETH ($375) each starting today. All future Chronophotographs can be taken by the Noumenon owners or delegated wallets. The Noumenon NFTs were already privately pre-sold, and the eventual owners can mint as many future Chronophotographs as they’d like.

In the run-up to today’s sale, noted artists like Art Blocks founder Erick “snowfro” Calderon, the pseudonymous XCOPY, and Jen Stark were invited to capture Chronophotographs, with their respective wallet addresses forever associated on-chain with the minted NFT.

LACMA is also showing previous works by Deafbeef—whose earliest NFT compositions in 2021 have traded hands for six-figure sums—in connection with the project.

Other artists that have participated in “Remembrance of Things Future” so far include Stark, Monica Rizzoli, Ix Shells, Emily Xie, and Sarah Zucker, each of whom were inspired by existing works within LACMA’s permanent collection.

"Business","Coinbase Reports Q1 Revenue of $736M, Up 22% From Q4","Business","Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase reported a loss for the first fiscal quarter, but the chills of crypto winter nipped at the San Fransisco-based firm far less than expected.

The leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange disclosed a Q1 loss of $79 million, its fifth straight quarterly loss. But, on a per-share basis, the exchange posted a loss of $0.34, far outperforming analyst expectations of $1.45, and much less severe compared to a loss of $1.98 a year ago.

AD

The company’s revenue was down compared to the first quarter of last year when Coinbase reported $1.1 billion in sales. The exchange reported $736 million net revenue on Thursday, beating analysts' forecasts, and building on the momentum it established at the tail end of last year despite the collapse of its competitor FTX.

Coinbase’s Vice President of Investor Relations Anil Gupta noted that revenue was up 22% sequentially in an interview with Decrypt, pointing to growth in both revenue from trading and subscriptions and services. “This quarter, it was a real turning point in our efforts to turn the company around,” he said.

Shares of Coinbase started tradings hands this year at $33.60 and had grown 47% to $49.34 as of market close on Thursday. In after-hours trading, the company’s share price was up over 7% to $52.75.

Year-over-year, trading volume decreased and customers showed signs of being less active, a metric Coinbase reports as monthly transacting users (MTUs).

Coinbase reported MTUs averaged 8.4 million during its latest quarter, a decrease compared to 9.2 million during the same period a year ago. But the figure represented a slight increase compared to its 2022 average of 8.3 million, suggesting an uptick in digital asset prices was good for Coinbase’s appeal to retail traders.

“In general, [we] took a much scrappier approach with more nimble teams,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said during an earnings call, noting the company was able to cut its operating expenses by 24% quarter-over-quarter. Coinbase CFO Alicia Haas attributed the firm’s better-than-expected subscription and services revenue to a bump in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which bolstered revenue from custody services and staking.

Following A Tough Year

Coinbase’s business benefited from sky-high digital asset prices in 2021, but its business faced headwinds last year.

Trading volume on Coinbase totaled $145 billion in the first quarter, a drop compared to $309 billion a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions and services, which Coinbase has said comprise the most “stable and predictable elements” of its business grew to $361 million in the first quarter, a notable increase compared to $151 million last year. 

AD

While individual consumers are a vital part of Coinbase’s business, the exchange offers products and services tailored toward institutional customers like banks, hedge funds, and corporations. This includes both asset custody and staking, areas of contention between Coinbase and the SEC.

Coinbase anticipated its focus on transparency and compliance would benefit the firm amid heightened regulatory scrutiny. But as a potential enforcement action that could put its products like staking in jeopardy looms, Coinbase’s attitude towards regulation has turned confrontational.

At the same time, Coinbase is looking offshore for opportunities to grow its business. It unveiled its Bermuda-based international exchange on Tuesday, offering financial products like perpetual futures on Bitcoin and Ethereum that aren’t allowed in the U.S.

Editor's note: This story was updated after publication to include comments from Coinbase's VP of Investor Relations Anil Gupta and CEO Brain Armstrong.

DCG is one of the largest crypto conglomerates on the market and counts Grayscale Investments, the trust’s issuer, as one of its subsidiaries.

AD

According to the filing, Silbert has moved to liquidate nearly 120,000 ETCG shares, worth an aggregate market value of approximately $755,295 dollars. This also appears to be the first time Silbert has sold any of his ETCG shares, according to SEC filings.

The ETCG fund, which launched in 2017, allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum Classic (ETC) through a brokerage account. ETC and Ethereum (ETH) used to be the same thing until 2016, when developers implemented a hard fork of the network to return millions worth of stolen funds to investors after a hack. The fork was notably backed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

The ETCG sale represents a small portion of the fund’s $225 million assets under management and 14 million outstanding shares—of which Silbert is a 10% shareholder. He’s also listed as one of the fund’s directors.

The sale was brokered by New York-based firm Cannacord Genuity on April 28 on the OTCQX, the highest tier of over-the-counter (OTC) market for trading securities, according to the SEC filing.

Silbert’s shares were originally purchased during two privately negotiated transactions over the 2017-2018 period. So far, he hasn’t made any official comments on the recent transaction.

Earlier this week, the companies announced they had entered into a 30-day mediation process to settle the outstanding loan balance. “If DCG is unable to pay and/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations,” Gemini said in a statement.

According to the team at Avalanche, “Cloudverse gives businesses an easy, white-glove, and cost-effective way to expand their brands to the Web3 virtual world.”

A third partner, Metaverse Universal Assets DAO (commonly known as MUA DAO), will provide the middleware, offering a service layer that will help integrate and customize the metaverses waiting to be built.

AD

But with billions of dollars running through the pipelines of cryptocurrency protocols, finding and fixing vulnerabilities has become a costly problem to solve.

Immunefi acts as a bug bounty crowdsourcing platform. Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) developers post bounties, or rewards, for reports of vulnerabilities found in their code. Then computer security experts—or white hat hackers—stab and poke at codebases until they find a vulnerability. If their report checks out, they collect the bounty and get a tally added to their score on the leaderboard. 

The highest-earning hacker on the platform has earned $13 million from submitting four reports so far. And Immunefi has paid out more than $75 million total since it launched in 2021. Although the company is beginning to flourish now, for the first two years it struggled to gain traction.

According to Amador, the issue was that it was more financially profitable to exploit a cryptocurrency protocol and steal millions rather than report a bug and claim a bounty. But that’s how Amador learned how to hone his don’t-be-a-bad-guy elevator pitch.

gm: Meet Immunefi's White Hat Whisperer

When Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi launched two years ago, CEO and founder Mitchell Amador says the bug bounties weren't great and adoption was slow. But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. ""There's a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else,"" he said. ""There's no way someone's not going to come looking.""

Go to video page

“Imagine we go to that same guy, and we say instead of $200 million, we'll pay you $10 million. We'll make you famous. We’ll glorify you. We’ll help you build your career—and there's no risk attached with this,” he said. “Nobody's going to come after you. Nobody's going to follow you. Nobody's going to look for you and break your legs. Nobody's going to file a criminal case and nobody's going to send you to jail. None of the bad stuff. Instead, you're going to be a hero.”

The framing used by ImmuneFi is that the risk associated with stealing from a cryptocurrency protocol is simply too big, no matter what the financial reward might be. A black hat hacker will always be looking over his shoulder.

“Why do you do it? Because there are other values in life, other things that are worth more. And because the downsides to engaging in the action are very substantial,” he said. “You steal that money, you have a life of looking over your shoulder. It's not always going to be worth it.

Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up
Discover GG

The crypto wallet race is heating up—Immutable launched its Passport wallet in beta this week, and this one is targeting gamers.

Immutable’s Passport works across games on its Ethereum scaling network, Immutable X, and is non-custodial—which means Immutable does not have access to users’ funds and each wallet creator is responsible for maintaining security.

AD

Compared to more traditional digital wallets like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet, Immutable Passport users don’t need a password to login—they can simply use an email address and submit a verification code sent to their email. Immutable claims that user security is not compromised as a result of the simpler sign-in process.

The Immutable Passport offers fiat deposits, withdrawals, and crypto swaps within the wallet, so users won’t have to go through the hassle of using a third-party crypto exchange and migrating funds. This also means that if games want to offer users the ability to pay with fiat currency instead of IMX or Ethereum, they’ll be able to do so from their wallet.

Unlike Ethereum sidechain Polygon, Immutable X users don’t need the network’s token in their wallet to pay for gas fees. On Polygon—which is powering the next-generation Immutable zkEVM scaling network—users need a small amount of MATIC to cover transaction costs.

Why does Immutable’s new gaming-centric wallet matter? Digital wallets create an extra layer of friction for those new to crypto—and that friction could drive away gamers. If Immutable can crack the onboarding puzzle, then it may help the Immutable platform become the leader in Web3 gaming.

“The two biggest challenges facing Web3 game studios today are security and player onboarding,” Immutable Product Lead Michael Powell told Decrypt, adding that “the complexity of a crypto wallet often leads to confusion and skepticism.”

And while there are plenty of crypto companies offering different types of wallets—like MetaMask, Coinbase, Brave, Phantom, Uniswap, and Robinhood—it remains to be seen whether the fledgling Web3 gaming industry will be able to onboard users to crypto without seeing massive user dropoff.

“The vast majority of wallet solutions available today aren’t designed for gamers and actually detract from an immersive gaming experience,” Powell said.

PEPE is based on Pepe the Frog, a internet meme labeled a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League after alt-right groups bizarrely adopted it.

It has surged in value since its launch; one investor managed to turn $250 into $1.02 million.

Though the astronomical gains aren't always what they seem: Liquidity is an issue with meme coins. That means exiting a position to cash out in ""real"" money—like U.S. dollars—would be very difficult and could lead to a collapse in the price of the asset, experts told Decrypt. 

 

Meme coins, like Dogecoin, have been around since 2013. But they started to gain mainstream attention when Elon Musk, one of the world's richest people, started pumping Dogecoin on Twitter in 2019. The cryptocurrency surged in value to gain a spot in the top ten cryptocurrencies—and at one point had a larger market cap than many companies on the S&P 500.

“He basically got a lot of money from myself for cars,” Wozniak said, before adding “I believed things he said—a car would drive itself across the country by the end of 2016. I had to upgrade to that model, you know, $50,000… and it wouldn’t do anything.”

“I could tell it wouldn’t make it across the country” he summarized. He then admitted to making the same expensive mistake a year later after Musk advertised “a new one with eight cameras [that’ll] make it across the country by the end of 2018.” 

Wozniak says Musk’s marketing spiel is “not even close to reality and boy if you want a study of AI gone wrong and taking a lot of claims and trying to kill you every chance it can, get a Tesla.”  

This is not the first time that Wozniak has used hyperbolic language to express his Tesla regret. Back in February, he told Fortune magazine that Tesla has “robbed my family of so much money” after he purchased the two electric vehicles. 

Great minds think alike

Despite Wozniak’s sharp criticisms of Tesla’s AI functionality, both he and Musk share a common cause: both are concerned by the rate of development of artificial intelligence systems. 

In March this year, the pair were leading signatories to an online petition calling for ChatGPT developer OpenAI to halt development for six months on any system more clever than GPT-4, the latest iteration of the intelligent, multi-talented chatbot.

The company will stop issuing new loans from May 10, although current users of the product will not be impacted as their loans will remain active until their maturity.

AD

""We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we’re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most,"" a Coinbase spokesperson told Decrypt. ""Effective May 10, we will stop issuing new loans through Coinbase Borrow. There is no impact on customers’ outstanding loans, and no action is required from them at this time.""

Launched in November 2021, Coinbase Borrow allows users from certain U.S. states to borrow up to $1 million using Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral.

Customers can borrow up to 40% of the value of the Bitcoin in their accounts at an annual interest rate of 8.7%, according to the exchange's website.

No relation to regulatory pressure, says Coinbase

The exchange has also indicated that the closure of Coinbase Borrow has nothing to do with the potential enforcement action that may be undertaken following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) slapping the exchange with a Wells Notice in March.

A Wells Notice is a letter that the SEC sends when it is considering bringing an enforcement action. The notice gives the recipient the opportunity to respond to the allegations made by the agency and explain why they believe enforcement action is not warranted.

"Business","Genesis 'One of the Main Feeder Funds' to Fraudulent FTX Activities, Say Debtors","Business","In another notable turn of events in the FTX Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the collapsed crypto exchange is now attempting to recover approximately $3.9 billion from Genesis Global Capital (GGC).

In a May 3 filing, FTX said it intends to begin adversary proceedings against GGC “to claw back funds received by Genesis and non-debtor affiliates so that these funds can be shared with all other creditors of the FTX Debtors in the FTX Chapter 11 Cases.”

AD

According to FTX, “these creditors include several million customers owed over $11 billion as of the time of filing of FTX Chapter 11 Cases.""

The filing also called Genesis ""one of the main feeder funds” for FTX and its sister company Alameda Research and said that Genesis received avoidable transfers from FTX’s debtors totaling almost $3.9 billion.

“Genesis was one of the main feeder funds for FTX and instrumental to its fraudulent business model,"" reads the document. ""At one point in 2021, GGC had over $8 billion of outstanding loans to FTX Debtor Alameda Research Ltd.”

Arthur Hayes: Market Makers Knew They’d Be Front-Run on FTX—It Was 'Common Knowledge'

Anyone familiar with crypto trading had a pretty good “spidey sense” that something wasn't right with the now bankrupt digital asset exchange FTX, according to Arthur Hayes. The former BitMEX CEO claims just about everyone knew that the failed crypto exchange FTX was “a little bit shady,” but most investors in the company were blinded by greed, he says.

The filing further stated that “the business model of GGC was to gather cryptocurrency from various lenders, pass those loans through to Alameda and other borrowers, and receive a profit in the form of a net interest margin.”

“As part of their business arrangements with the FTX Debtors, GGC and GGC International maintained customer accounts on the FTX.com and GGC provided billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency loans to Alameda,” added the filing.

Genesis is a subsidiary of Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group. Its lending business, Genesis Global Holdco, and two of its lending subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January this year.

FTX did not respond immediately to Decrypt’s request for comment. A Genesis spokesperson told Decrypt via email that ""Genesis remains focused on our restructuring process, through which we are working to reach a consensual resolution that maximizes value for all Genesis clients and stakeholders.”

Breaking down the FTX claims

According to Wednesday's filing, which FTX said “is based on currently available information,” Alameda repaid approximately $1.8 billion in loans to Genesis, while also pledging $273 million to Genesis in the 90 days before FTX filed for bankruptcy.

AD

Additionally, the filing claims that over the same period, Genesis withdrew another $1.6 billion from FTX, while its affiliate company Genesis Global Capital International withdrew another $213 million.

According to FTX, the resolution of the clawback claims will partly depend on “the determination of central issues,” such as “the valuation of collateral and the proprietary FTT token as well as payment practices on retail international cryptocurrency exchanges.”

“As many figured—deployment of crvUSD smart contracts has happened!” tweeted the Curve Finance team. “This is not finalized yet because UI also needs to be deployed. Stay tuned!”

AD

Launched during the DeFi summer of 2020, Curve Finance is a stablecoin-centric decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates cheap swaps between stablecoins and other fixed-priced assets such as derivatives of Ethereum. It’s the second-largest DEX by volume after Uniswap.

CrvUSD is an over-collateralized stablecoin backed by assets like USDC, Ethereum, liquid staking derivatives like Frax’s sfrxETH, and liquidity provision tokens of stablecoin pools.

Currently, only borrowing against Frax’s sfrxETH is enabled. The sfrxETH token represents the ETH staked via Frax Finance and accrues the staking yield from the Frax ETH validators.

Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov executed the first crvUSD loan worth $1 million against $1.8 million worth of sfrxETH as collateral.

Another Ethereum user borrowed 5,000 crvUSD against 3.56 sfrxETH, worth around $6,780.

According to DeFiLlama, the crvUSD smart contract has $1.82 million worth of collateral.

“Firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others,” the report states, adding that the proposed tax “encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society.”

AD

The proposed excise tax would impact digital asset miners beginning in 2024 and require any such firm to pay Uncle Sam a tax that’s based on their associated electricity costs—starting out at 10% and ticking up each year until it reaches 30%. 

The White House’s 2024 budget, which introduced the tax in March, estimates that it could help the government reduce its deficit by $74 million in the first year, potentially growing to $444 million by the fiscal year 2033.

Under the official name of the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax, it applies equally to digital asset miners that earn income by validating transactions on proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin and proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, despite having vastly different levels of energy consumption.

The report estimates that crypto miners in the U.S. consumed around 50,000 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2022 between Bitcoin and Ethereum, almost as much as televisions and notably more than home computers. 

In order to estimate these numbers, the White House started with global estimates of crypto mining power use and segmented out a representative fraction for U.S.-based Bitcoin and Ethereum operations.

As part of the proposed tax, digital asset miners would be required to disclose the amount of electricity they use, its source—whether it’s from renewables or not—and its associated value. It also applies to power generated off-grid, such as converting what would otherwise be wasted natural gas.

“So, apparently it doesn’t matter where the electricity comes from,” he said on Twitter. “If the government doesn’t like how you use the energy, you’ll be penalized.”

Aside from raising environmental concerns, the administration argues that digital asset mining disproportionately impacts communities of color because of pollution and drives up renewable energy costs. The report also makes a value judgment on crypto.

“Cryptomining does not generate the local and national economic benefits typically associated with businesses using similar amounts of electricity,” it states. “Instead, the energy is used to generate digital assets whose broader social benefits have yet to materialize.”

FTX was a global crypto brand that mainly allowed customers to buy, sell, and bet on the future price of digital assets. The firm very quickly and unexpectedly went bust in November, due to what prosecutors now allege was gross mismanagement, including the co-mingling of funds.

The SEC further alleges that ex-FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried, who claimed he barely slept and took stimulants to run the crypto behemoth, concealed his diversion of FTX customer funds to sister trading firm Alameda Research.

He is now facing 13 criminal charges—including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

The emergency cease and desist order was filed against Horatiu Charlie Caragaceanu, The Shark of Wall Street, and Hedge4.ai.

Texas regulators say TruthGPT Coin and its creator came to the agency’s attention during routine market surveillance looking into various artificial intelligence offerings.

AD

“We noted its previous and current coin offerings and conducted background research, and subsequently determined that it warranted an investigation to understand its operations better,” Texas State Securities Board Director of Enforcement Joseph Rotunda told Decrypt in an interview. “We found [TruthGPT Coin] by proactively trying to get ahead of the curve and identify the contemporary, trendy type of offerings that may pose a threat to the public.”

The TruthGPT Coin and Elon Musk AI Token were launched in March as a new digital asset investment campaign, Texas regulators said.

“The tokens are being marketed online through avatars portraying Elon Musk endorsing TruthGPT Coin and comparing it to ChatGPT, with the claim that purchasers can earn up to 1,000 times their investment,” the order reads. ""TruthGPT Coin is presented as an AI-powered cryptocurrency investment advisor, powered by Elon Musk AI.”

The order called the tokens part of a fraudulent securities scheme.

“In this case, we didn't allege a Ponzi scheme but rather a fraud through concealment of information and misleading statements,” Rotunda said. “We chose this approach because a thorough source and use analysis of assets in Ponzi cases takes time. We were concerned that waiting, given the hype around AI and the use of Elon Musk's persona, would do more harm than good.”

Securities Commissioner Travis Iles issued the emergency cease and desist order to “protect the public from immediate and irreparable harm.”

“Bad actors continue their attempts to capitalize on this widespread public interest,” Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles said in a statement. “They’re devising schemes that create the appearance they have developed sophisticated artificial intelligence platforms – but instead of being rooted in artificial intelligence, the offerings too often are nothing more than frauds.”

“Respondents marketed these digital assets as investments that would significantly increase in value, paid lucrative guaranteed returns, and/or generated considerable passive income,” the Texas State Securities Board said. “However, these digital assets are now valued at or around $0 per token.”

The TruthGPT Coin site also included images of Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, regulators said, in an apparent attempt to lend the scheme legitimacy.

Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, scammers have increasingly tried to capitalize on the AI craze and trick investors out of their money and cryptocurrency. In April, California regulators with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) issued cease and desist letters to five companies that it claimed had wrapped scams in a veneer of A.I.

Other state regulators joining Texas include the Alabama Securities Commission, the Montana State Auditor, the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions, and the New Jersey Securities Bureau.

“Since the pandemic, we've learned that scams don’t know boundaries; with increased connectivity scams cross are crossing from states to countries throughout the world,” Rotunda said. “Scammers don't limit themselves, so we shouldn’t limit ourselves to four corners.”

Bored was here for business. He looked more or less exactly like his voice sounds (he's a frequent Twitter Spaces host and guest), and he did not divulge his real name. Bored said that he started the parody account after Elon Musk published the Hyperloop white paper in 2013. 

“The paper basically said, ‘Here's the map of how to do it. I don’t have time, anybody who wants this can have it for free,’” Bored said. “And I just thought: OK, you do some pretty wild thinking while you’re bored.”

We were sitting on the sidewalk in uncomfortable metal chairs, his just feet from the road. We both held tiny microphones but no one around us seemed to notice or care as we talked about the rise of his gag account.

“I will say it was my 10th attempt at creating a parody account,” Bored told me. “And it is wild that, you know, the person that I ended up parodying now owns the platform itself. I never would have expected that timeline.”

Bored is not your typical Crypto Twitter “influencer.” He isn’t fresh out of college, yelling on Twitter Spaces, or wearing flashy clothes at drunken mosh-pit parties. He’s an introverted guy, a little bit corporate even, and said that he’s worked in the video game industry for a long time. I asked him where he had worked, but he kept his response vague. Bored does not want his real name to be revealed or uncovered under any circumstances.

“I’ve kind of stepped away from being this character,” Bored said of his Twitter evolution over the years. “But it’s kind of like being a writer for a show—like, you just run out of ideas. So I don’t necessarily want to play that character anymore.”

Bored has moved away from the comedy bits and rebranded as a co-founder of Web3 startup Bored Box, which he started with pseudonymous co-founder Subtle Rebuttal. Bored Box aims to showcase curated Web3 games and grant Box NFT holders with exclusive gaming NFTs and other perks.

He borrowed the ""Bored"" branding from his massively popular Twitter persona—and the vibe checks out, given that gaming is a common cure for boredom. Finding worthwhile games in the Web3 world right now, however, is a challenge in his view.

“The general problem we’re trying to solve for Web3 is that shopping for games and discovering games—it kind of sucks,” Bored said. “Every place you go to get games is like eBay, right? It’s just a trading platform.”

“What it really needs to look like is the Steam Store,” he added, “or the PlayStation Network Store or Nintendo eShop.”

As the Web3 gaming industry takes its relatively early steps, there are already a few different game launchers out there offering a range of titles in varying stages of development. Elixir, HyperPlay, and the Epic Games Store have emerged as early options for gamers looking to find vetted Web3 games.

Insider trading is using confidential information to one’s benefit in order to make lucrative trades.

"Markets","Bitcoin, Ethereum Flat as Fed Issues 10th Consecutive Interest Rate Hike","Markets","The Federal Reserve decided to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday. But it was the U.S. central bank's statement on a possible path forward that had markets waiting with bated breath.

To cool an overheated economy and tame soaring prices, the Fed has now delivered a steady barrage of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes since March 2022. That brings bringing its federal funds rate to a range of 5% to 5.25%.

AD

An increase of a quarter of a percent was widely expected, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which earlier today showed investors gave the rate hike an 85% chance of happening.

“Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday during a press conference. “Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go.”

While Bitcoin was slightly down prior to the Fed's move, it clawed back losses and settled around $28,634, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum reversed course as well, pushing higher on the back of the Fed’s statement to $1,886, a gain of 1.2% in the past day, according to CoinGecko.

So far this year, Bitcoin and Ethereum have notched gains of roughly 70% and 50%, respectively, in part on the notion that the Fed could put rate hikes on pause soon or even cut interest rates later in the year. That's because traders tend to avoid “risky” assets, like BTC and ETH, when they expect the U.S. central bank to continue its aggressive monetary policy in order to get inflation under control.

Over the same period, the Nasdaq Composite has risen around 17%.

For several months, Powell has said repeatedly that “ongoing increases” would be needed to send inflation back down to the Fed’s target of 2%. Inflation soared to 9.1% in June 2022, the highest it's been since 1981.

However, Powell’s tone began to shift in March after turmoil emerged in the U.S. banking sector that saw lenders toppled like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.

Instead of saying that “ongoing [interest rate] increases” will likely be needed, Powell said, “some additional policy firming may be appropriate” at the U.S. central bank’s previous Federal Open Markets Committee.

Now, the Fed is confronted with a potential debt ceiling crisis, where the U.S. risks defaulting on its debt for the first time in history. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that could happen as early as June 1 if Congress can’t reach an agreement.

"Coins","SUI Token Down 37%, Nears $1 Billion in Volume Following Network Launch","Coins","Sui’s mainnet went live on Wednesday without a hitch, catapulting the layer-1 blockchain’s SUI token into the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Yet, some traders are undoubtedly seeing red as SUI slides on its first day.

Since SUI began trading this morning on crypto exchanges like Binance, OKX, KuCoin, and Bybit, the coin has fallen roughly 37% to $1.37 from $2.16, according to CoinGecko. Its market cap currently sits at $716 million, blowing past meme coins like PEPE. 

AD

According to its fully diluted valuation (FDV), which accounts for the value of tokens that aren’t yet circulating, SUI is valued at an eye-popping $13.7 billion, as of this writing. The blockchain’s total number of tokens is capped at 10 billion, and its initial circulating supply was around 528 million, equal to 5.28% of all tokens. 

The blockchain’s development team Mysten Labs raised $300 million during a Series B funding round last fall at a valuation of $2 billion, according to Crunchbase, signaling a sense of buzz despite the chills of crypto winter.

The network is built around a proof-of-stake model, and its native token is used for staking, paying transaction fees, and participating in the blockchain’s governance process.

Leading up to the launch of its mainnet, traders could get their hands on SUI in various ways, whether that was through a so-called Recognition Sale facilitated by Bybit or farming SUI on Binance’s Launchpad.

KuCoin, OKX, and Bybit also participated in a token sale ahead of Wednesday, where they offered 225 million tokens each—notably, U.S.-based traders were forbidden. And SUI’s price at midday Wednesday represented a notable bump compared to the token’s pre-sale and initial coin offering (ICO) prices of $0.03 and $0.10, respectively.

Hours after Sui’s mainnet went live, Binance accounted for a lion's share of the token’s trading volume, which totaled over $941 million, according to CoinGecko. Binance accounted for around 55% of SUI volume, followed by Bybit (16%), OKX (11%), and KuCoin (8%). 

The Sui blockchain aims to deliver speedy transactions and improved scalability compared to other networks like Ethereum or Solana by leveraging a modified version of Move, a programming language that was originally developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) as part of the social media giant’s failed Diem project.

The Sui blockchain has drawn comparisons to Aptos, a layer-1 blockchain that went live last October and has been dubbed a “Solana killer.” Aptos also has Meta-based roots and leverages a form of the Move programming language.

AD

While many other tokens were in the red on Wednesday, Aptos’ APT token was down 2.7% to $9.61, as of this writing, according to CoinGecko. APT’s trajectory looked similar to SUI’s when it first launched, falling 40% when it first launched.

"NFTs","LeBron James Spotted in RTFKT Nike Sneakers—Clone X NFT Holders Rejoice","NFTs","LeBron James, arguably the most famous basketball star today, was photographed wearing special-edition Nike sneakers that can only be purchased by minting an Ethereum NFT created by Nike subsidiary, RTFKT. And the RTFKT founders apparently also presented the living legend with his very own Clone X NFT avatar, as well.

James was seen wearing the RTFKT x Nike Air Force 1 Genesis sneakers on Tuesday ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers’ Game 1 victory against the Golden State Warriors in the NBA’s Western Conference Semifinals. The Lakers tweeted a photo of James wearing the black and red kicks, alongside a photo of teammate Anthony Davis.

AD

The photo quickly went viral amongst RTFKT NFT holders, and then the company itself—which was acquired by Nike in December 2021—tweeted it out with a zoomed-in look at the shoes.

Shortly thereafter, RTFKT co-founder Steven “Zaptio” Vasilev shared a photo of himself and RTFKT COO Nikhil Gopalani presenting James with an honorary Clone X avatar. “We got [to] onboard the legend [LeBron James] to RTFKT with his 1/1 Clone X,” Vasilev wrote.

Decrypt reached out to RTFKT and Nike representatives for further details on the interactions with James, including whether it’s an extension of his existing long-term sponsorship deal with Nike and whether he actually took custody of any NFTs. Neither company immediately responded.

The RTFKT x Nike Air Force 1 Genesis is a set of just 1,776 total pairs of sneakers in that style that can only be obtained by purchasing an NFT and then redeeming it for the physical product. Secondary market prices for the Genesis NFTs start at 0.4 ETH, or $740 on OpenSea. The physical sneakers can only be redeemed until May 8, per an official FAQ.

There are several other RTFKT x Nike Air Force 1 styles of NFT-based kicks also available in varying quantities and at different secondary market prices. The most limited style, called “Alien” and featuring something of a neon twist on the Lakers’ own yellow and purple look, has a total supply of just 60 pairs that start at 5 ETH ($9,245).

Clone X is an Ethereum NFT profile picture (PFP) project that launched in 2021 as a collaboration between RTFKT and Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami. It has gone on to become one of the most prominent and successful PFP projects in the space, generating nearly $835 million worth of trading volume to date per data from CryptoSlam.

AD

Last September, RTFKT changed the metadata—or the data that defines the unique qualities of a particular NFT asset—for a single Clone X NFT to feature an “LBJ Beard” and a yellow and purple crown, both of which no other NFT in the collection has.

The Clone X avatar that James is holding in the image shared Tuesday has the same visual attributes as that NFT, albeit with an all-blue color scheme. It’s unclear whether it’s a separate NFT from the one that was modified last September. That one remains in the custody of the “RTFKT_CORE_VAULT” wallet, per data from OpenSea, and was last transferred in January.

Beyond the various NFT creations of its RTFKT subsidiary, Nike has also launched its own digital sneakers and apparel platform called .SWOOSH on Ethereum scaling network Polygon. Nike said last month that it already has over 330,000 users on .SWOOSH, and will begin its mint for “Our Force 1” NFT-based sneakers starting May 8.

The jump in value comes as hype around Bitcoin Ordinals grows: activity around the latest crypto craze is surging. Similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ordinals are digital assets inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Stacks is built on top of Bitcoin; it allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts secured by the original network.

Other than STX, Rocket Pool (RPL) is also up—by 7.5%—and trading for $50.27. The asset allows investors to stake the second biggest cryptocurrency Ethereum via its decentralized pool. Rocket Pool runs a liquid staking protocol, giving depositors Rocket Ethereum (rETH) in exchange for the ETH they deposit.

Interest in staking has surged (especially via decentralized pools) since Ethereum moved to a proof-of-stake blockchain last year. This now means that holders of ETH can earn rewards by ""locking-up"" the cryptocurrency to keep the blockchain running smoothly.

"Business","New York, Berlin Tied for Second Place as 'Most Important Crypto Hub': Survey","Business","A new survey suggests one European capital is best poised to lure in even more of the industry.

European crypto projects have named Lisbon as the world’s most important crypto hub, according to its biannual State of European Crypto Report 2023 published today by European crypto investment firm Greenfield.

AD

The report anonymously surveyed 68 heads of companies and protocols whose founding members are European in origin or are also headquartered in Europe. Despite the anonymized survey, a spokesperson from Greenfield estimated that a third of respondents were also portfolio companies. 

“We have great confidence that Europe's crypto scene will continue to prosper, bolstered by the MiCA regulation, which will solidify Europe's position as one of the world's most important industry hubs,” Jascha Samadi, a co-founding partner told Decrypt via email. “Even amidst the current bear market and compared to the last market downturn in 2018, we see remarkable growth in the European builder community and, besides that, clear signs of the industry's maturation.""

Half (50%) of respondents put Lisbon in their personal top three most relevant crypto hubs in the world. Berlin and New York jointly held second place, having each been mentioned by 35% of respondents. Paris came in seventh place.

Unsurprisingly, when asked to pick just one European city respondents consider the “most relevant” to the industry, Lisbon trumped again in the eyes of 35% of project founders.

The most commonly cited reasons for championing the Portuguese capital include its strong decentralized finance (DeFi) scene and favorable tax laws. 

State of European Crypto: key takeaways

Greenfield’s new report comes two weeks after European lawmakers approved the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill, the bloc’s first attempt to establish a unified and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto among its 27 member states. 

Regulations were cited as the most influential topic of 2023 for 70% of respondents. Issues around privacy and identity came far behind in second place among 35% of projects. 

When asked to rank the main hurdles on the way towards mass adoption, most European projects gave pride of place to improve the user experience of crypto. Issues of regulation came in second place. 

AD

Most of the respondents nearly unanimously agree that after the serious turmoil of 2022, which was bookended by the historic collapses of stablecoin issuer Terra and crypto exchange FTX, this year will be one of industry regeneration and the cleansing of bad actors. 

There’s no shortage of new development talent to help them grow the tech. In a section that looked at 42 top companies and protocols with strong European footprints, Greenfield found that there were 1,300 monthly developers in Q1 2023 (according to their GitHub repositories).

Demand for Blockchain Devs Is Soaring—But Not Just in Crypto

Last year was one of the most chaotic for the broader crypto industry. After FTX’s collapse, thousands of employees were laid off, and many firms, especially those in the mining sector, shut shop entirely. After layoffs and bankruptcies, cryptocurrencies were also hit hard. The industry's market cap plummeted from roughly $2.23 trillion at the start of 2022 to just $832 million at the start of 2023, starting in earnest from June onwards and intensifying following the implosion of FTX, according ...

This number marked an increase of 300 from Q4 2022, the most substantial spike yet. 

It’s all the more remarkable, says Greenfield, given that the same sector lost ground in terms of market capitalization. 

After having almost 6% of the combined market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum at the peak of their heady bull run back in Q4 2021, the same projects now have 2.5% (or $20 billion) in Q1 2023.

The Sui blockchain is a Move-based, layer-1 blockchain platform developed by former Meta (formerly Facebook) engineers who worked on the now-defunct Novi project.

AD

Mysten Labs, the development team behind the blockchain, raised a $300 million investment in a Series B round in September 2022.

According to the testnet’s performance, the blockchain can reportedly achieve high throughputs between 10,871 transactions per second (TPS) to 297,000 TPS on various workloads. For comparison, Solana, one of the fastest layer-1 blockchains, boasts a TPS of roughly 4,000.

High-performance blockchains have made headlines for their aims to alleviate scalability issues facing heavyweights like Ethereum. Other competitors, include Near and Aptos.

SUI is the native token of the project for paying transaction fees and governance purposes. The total supply of SUI tokens is 10 billion, per Binance's Launchpad announcement. The initial circulating supply of the token will be 528,273,717, representing 5.28% of the total token supply.

The token is trading at $1.33, per CoinGecko, after falling from $2.16 within minutes of its launch. This puts the project's market capitalization at $704 million. It's fully diluted valuation (FDV), or total supply of tokens including those not currently in circulation, is more than $13 billion.

The Sui Foundation partnered with centralized exchanges like Kucoin, OKX, Bybit, and Binance to sell the tokens to the project’s Discord community and other exchange users.

The exchanges raised $49 million from over 100,000 users, and Binance users staked over $4 billion worth of crypto tokens to farm SUI tokens.

The scope of the partnership is to launch crypto mining operations that will deploy ""100% carbon-free"" hydroelectric power in a new mining center in the Kingdom of Bhutan, the company said in a press release Wednesday.

AD

To that end, Bitdeer and DHI plan to establish a closed-end fund with a goal of raising up to $500 million “from the international community,” read the announcement.

The fundraiser is expected to begin by the end of the month.

“We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan’s zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value,” Bitdeer chairman Jihan Wu said in a statement. The venture is hoped to also drive tech growth in the region, said Wu.

The Singapore-based Bitdeer, which has already deployed cryptocurrency mining data centers in the U.S. and Norway, went public last month on the Nasdaq exchange through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Blue Safari Group.

As per a regulatory filing, Bitdeer is planning to establish a 100-megawatt operation in Bhutan, with construction scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2023 and conclude between July and September.

This makes Bhutan a natural choice for crypto mining, with a recent The Bhutanese report claiming that DHI was one of the early entrants in the local mining industry when the price of Bitcoin was around $5,000.

The last time the leading cryptocurrency traded at those levels was in March 2020, according to CoinGecko.

Notably, the report also said DHI has previously borrowed funds from the now-bankrupt crypto lending companies BlockFi and Celsius, with the company’s CEO Ujjwal Deep Dahal asserting that “Bhutan had borrowed some digital assets as a loan to make certain investments and everything has been paid back and settled with no dues.”

"NFTs","Bitcoin Daily Transactions Hit All-Time High With 3 Million Ordinals Inscriptions","NFTs","The total fees paid for Ordinal inscriptions topped 272 BTC, around $7.6 million on Tuesday, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. On Monday alone, over 372,000 inscriptions were created on the Bitcoin network—contributing to a daily record 682,281 Bitcoin transactions—with daily network fees hitting 23 BTC, or around $656,000.

AD

“Most of the acceleration is BRC-20,” Trevor Owens, Managing Partner at Bitcoin Frontier Fund, told Decrypt. The BRC-20 token standard made minting tokens and meme coins on the Bitcoin network possible, clearing the path for over 1 million more inscriptions to be added to the over 2.5 million already on the Bitcoin network in less than a week.

Introduced in March, BRC-20—or Bitcoin Request for Comment number 20—allowed the creation of fungible tokens using the Ordinals protocol launching a new wave of interest in minting NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.

But while JPEGs are flooding the network, most inscriptions are still text-based.

“Text inscriptions are lower cost since you pay based on the size of the data,” Owens said. “So they are low-cost high volume, whereas JPEGs and digital media is high cost, low volume.”

Currently, the memory usage on the Bitcoin network is over 650 MB, double the initial 300 MB capacity, indicating a higher demand for computer memory due to the increased transactions and fuller blocks, according to data from Mempool. This increase may make running a node more challenging, but Ordinals proponents say it secures and strengthens the network.

“As long as the value gained from minting BRC-20 tokens is higher than the value lost to the inscription fees, we will see fees on Bitcoin continue to climb,” pseudonymous Twitter user @LeonidasNFT said, adding that higher fees on Bitcoin are a very good thing.

“It indicates strong demand for Bitcoin’s block space, which is critical for the long-term success of the protocol,” Leonidas said. “The days of only using Bitcoin to transfer BTC to your hardware wallet once every few years have come to an end.”

High fees benefit the Bitcoin blockchain by incentivizing miners, prioritizing valuable transactions, and enhancing network security. However, while loading up the Bitcoin blockchain with JPEGs and sending fees skyrocketing may be good for miners and the network’s security, it puts a higher price tag on transactions on the network.

“In February, we inscribed the Taproot Wizards collection, which took over 80MB of Bitcoin block space,” Taproot Wizards tweeted. “But now bitcoin transaction fees are so high, that if we tried inscribing the 80MB of wizards today, the fees would’ve cost us 32 BTC. Almost $1 million dollars.”

“I think this is the best thing that could have happened to Bitcoin,” Owens said, pointing out that the launch and development of Ordinals did not require changing the Bitcoin base protocol. “We’ve unlocked new use cases to bring in liquidity, new users, and lots of developers making Bitcoin more valuable through better user experience and more use cases is what we need to reach mass adoption.”

Which exchanges will be supporting SUI? A number of smaller exchanges—BitForex, DigiFinex, HotBit and SuperEx—have allowed customers to buy IOU versions of the tokens in advance. Of the major exchanges, Binance, OKX, KuCoin, and ByBit have all made announcements. American citizens and residents are ineligible to receive SUI. 

Binance

The world’s biggest crypto exchange announced last week that users will first be able to farm SUI via Binance Launcpool, a DeFi platform that allows users to farm new assets. Binance will then list SUI when its liquidity meets the requirement and open trading with SUI/BTC, SUI/USDT, SUI/TUSD and SUI/BNB trading pairs, the company added. 

OKX

SUI will also be available via Seychelles-based crypto exchange OKX’s Jumpstart platform, according to a blog post. The exchange last month said that users could get involved first via a token allocation lottery where holders of OKB (the exchange’s native token) could buy lottery tickets. Winners of the lottery would then be allowed to buy SUI. 

The exchange also said it would allow users to view and trade assets on Sui via its OKX mobile app and OKX Wallet web extension.

KuCoin

KuCoin has said that tokens will be available to investors immediately when the mainnet goes live tomorrow. The trading pair will only be SUI/USDT, and USDT-margined futures will be available at a later date when its liquidity meets the requirement, according to the exchange. 

Bybit

Bybit launched a SUI “recognition sale” last month—only allowing selected community members to snap up the token. Spot trading will be available for retail traders with SUI/USDT and SUI/USDC pairs from tomorrow, the exchange has said.

"Business","Ron Desantis Renews Attack on CBDCs as Part of 'Woke Politics'","Business","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis took another swing at a U.S. digital dollar today even as he defended crypto as a whole, unveiling a series of state legislative proposals that would combat ""woke politics.""

""They don't like crypto because they can't control crypto,"" he said in answer to a question posed at a Tuesday press conference. ""They want to get rid of crypto, which my view is, if you want to invest in crypto, it's up to you, you can do it, you can make those decisions.""

AD

""They,"" presumably, refers to Democrats in Washington, D.C., who have—along with Republicans—made cryptocurrency a major policy issue. DeSantis suggested that his political opponents are pursuing the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which would be issued, backed, and tracked by the government.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Introduces State Legislation Banning CBDCs

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis proposed legislation on Monday that would ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) from the Sunshine State, portraying it as a measure to safeguard Floridians’ financial privacy. The legislation would prohibit in Florida any CBDC that the U.S. Federal Reserve could introduce and any created by a foreign government, outlawing the technology entirely from being used as a form of money within the state. DeSantis introduced the legislation from behind a podium with t...

DeSantis had previously announced a state bill to ban CBDCs, branding it as “Big Brother’s Digital Dollar.""

""The danger of the digital currency is that they want to make that the sole currency—they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency,"" he said. ""I think that that's fundamentally wrong, so we're recognizing the dangers with this agenda.""

The press conference was titled ""Government of Laws, Not Woke Politics,"" and was focused on a package of bills that oppose ""'Environment, Social, and Governance"" or ESG policies. Such policies stem from a push to introduce factors beyond pure financial performance in evaluating a company or organization, such as environmental and community impact.

""So-called 'ESG' policies represent an attempt to impose, through the economy, an ideological agenda,"" the DeSantis campaign declared, saying they ""prioritize woke ideals and virtue signaling over commonsense financial practices.""

Galaxy Digital Announces Sustainability Plan, Touts 80% Clean Mining

The legislative package blocks the use of ESG in all investment decisions at the state and local level in order to ensure that ""only financial factors are considered to maximize the return on investment."" It also bans the financial sector from considering so-called ""social credit scores"" in banking and lending practices—a practice some link to a social rating system implemented in China.

Another bill bans discriminating against customers for their religious, political, or social beliefs, and DeSantis says examples of the latter include ""owning a firearm, securing the border, or increasing our energy independence.""

The governor tied a CBDC to these ""woke"" practices by saying that proponents ""will impose ESG and social credit scores onto that, and that's going to be a huge reduction in freedom for people in this country.""

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Joins Ron DeSantis in Railing Against CBDCs

As potential candidates fine-tune their platforms in anticipation of 2024 presidential campaigns, Robert F.

""I don't think Congress would authorize it, but if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally in Florida, we'll have a prohibition against that,"" he said. ""That's ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don't have a financial surveillance state where they know every transaction that you're making.""

In announcing the proposed ban on CBDCs in March, DeSantis said the digital dollar is ""all about is surveilling Americans and controlling Americans.”

“You're opening up a major can of worms, and you're handing a central bank huge, huge amounts of power,"" he added. ""And they will use that power.”

DeSantis has been a front-line warrior in the war against ""woke politics"" currently firing up the national Republican party. He remains embroiled in a high-profile battle with Disney, one of Florida's largest economic drivers and employers.

The global entertainment giant spoke out last spring against Florida laws banning the inclusion of LGBTQ content in school curricula. In retribution, DeSantis is attempting to clip Disney's wings, calling it ""a woke corporation based in California.""

"Coins","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Wades Further Into Crypto Following Anti-CBDC Remarks","Coins","Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. came out swinging on behalf of the digital assets industry on Tuesday, criticizing what he called a “war on crypto” following earlier remarks he made opposing a U.S. central bank digital currency, or CBDC.

Kennedy, who officially announced his 2024 presidential bid last month, said that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have “no authority to wage an extra-legal war on crypto that leaves major banks as collateral damage.”

AD

Referencing an article written by Ellen Brown titled “How the War on Crypto Triggered a Banking Crisis,” Kennedy said Brown makes a “strong case” that a government-led campaign against the digital assets industry led to several historic bank failures in March, specifically Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate Bank.

Whether or not there’s a concerted effort to uproot crypto from the U.S. financial system is a contentious topic. Barney Frank, an ex-congressman who sat on Signature Bank’s board of directors, said the institution was shut down to send an anti-crypto message. A New York regulator has denied those claims.

Regardless, Kennedy’s comments mark an increased focus on the digital assets industry as he aims to dash President Joe Biden’s reelection hopes. And though he’s been described as a fringe candidate, his remarks capture how crypto has become a hot-button political issue as the forthcoming election cycle kicks into gear.

Comments Kennedy made last month in opposition of a CBDC paralleled those of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a potential challenger to former president Donald Trump. Both have warned the technology could be prone to abuses of power and threaten the privacy of its users.

The Federal Reserve issued clarity days after Kennedy’s anti-CBDC remarks, saying the launch of its FedNow payments system is neither a digital currency nor a replacement for cash, which Kennedy appeared to conflate with a CBDC. 

While certain Democrats like Elizabeth Warren have slammed crypto numerous times and made criticism of the industry a key pillar of their political platform, others like New York City Mayor Eric Adams have been vocal in their support for the nascent asset class.

But Republicans, lately, have been more willing to publicly align themselves as advocates of crypto, whether that’s lawmakers like Tom Emmer (R-MN) or Ted Cruz (R-TX). In March, Emmer himself accused the FDIC of weaponizing instability in the banking sector to “purge legal digital asset entities” in the U.S. And just last week, Cruz criticized CBDCs himself, saying that they're designed to ""destroy all the value of Bitcoin.""

"Business","Balaji Srinivasan 'Burns' $1 Million in Bitcoin to Prove a Point","Business","Ex-Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan today said that he has now settled a high-profile Bitcoin bet made in March by donating $1.5 million of his own money. And he’s done it to prove a point, he says, that the U.S. economy is in such bad shape, people will flock to cryptocurrency instead.

Srinivasan initially announced a $1 million bet in March, claiming that the global economy is on the edge of rapid change, and as a result, we will see the rapid adoption of Bitcoin—which he calls “hyperbitcoinization.” 

AD

The original bet was made with Twitter pundit James Medlock and stipulated that if Bitcoin failed to hit $1 million within 90 days, he would receive $1 million in Circles USDC stablecoin.

Today, he said the bet had been “closed out by mutual agreement” and settled early, giving $500,000 to poverty charity Give Directly, $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers, and $500,000 to Medlock. 

“So, I settled the bet ahead of time and donated even more than I had committed,” he wrote today on Twitter. “I spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there’s something wrong with the economy, and that it's not going to be a ‘soft landing’ like Powell [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell] promises—but something much worse.”

While it could be viewed as ultimately conceding the bet, he claimed that his reasoning for donating the money before the 90-days were up is that he “believes in the public good, but unfortunately we can't rely on the public sector anymore to tell us when something's wrong.” 

Srinivasan insists that the American economy will enter hyperinflation and Bitcoin will be a go-to safe haven—eventually hitting a market cap of $19.3 trillion. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $555 billion. 

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading for $28,827, according to CoinGecko, meaning it would have to shoot up in value by 3,369% to hit $1 million per coin. 

The asset is currently vauled 58% less than its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044. But in May 2013, it was priced at $123.10, meaning that over a decade, the original digital currency has appreciated by 23,317%. 

AD

Srinivasan went on to say that economic catastrophe was coming and that he made the donations to make the point that “things could unwind very fast.” 

“Many things are breaking at once,” he continued, referring to the U.S. debt ceiling, the banking crisis, bonds losing value, and the Russia-Ukraine war. 

“I just burned a million to tell you they’re printing trillions.”

"Business","Sui Token and Network Launch: What You Need to Know","Business","The highly touted Sui mainnet is set to officially launch on Wednesday, May 3 at 8 a.m. ET. 

A layer 1 designated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) blockchain, the protocol uses a modified version of the Move programming language initially created at Meta–formerly Facebook–before it decided to wind down its Diem project.

AD

Sui is built by Mysten Labs, one of the two spinoffs that came from Meta’s Diem project–the second being none other than so-called Solana Killer, Aptos Labs which launched its mainnet in October. Leading up to its launch, Sui has raised enormous amounts of money. By September last year, Mysten Labs had closed a $300 million Series B round and reached a $2 billion valuation, according to CrunchBase.

The team behind Sui has said it wants the network to become the premier NFT and gaming platform for the cryptocurrency industry, by virtue of its Move programming language, which developers have said is a more intuitive way to write smart contracts.

Although Move was not initially designed with NFTs in mind, Sui Move is looking to change that by implementing certain NFT-specific functions. Unlike another popular language, like Rust—which is used by Solana and focuses on “accounts”—Sui is centered around “objects.” That has made it possible for objects on Sui to be owned by a single user or “shared,” which can then be modified by users as long as they follow certain smart contract functionalities.

By doing so, the team behind Sui said the network is poised to become an “innovative, decentralized Layer 1 blockchain that redefines asset ownership.”

Sui Move has been highly touted for its speed and transaction throughput, with Solana’s Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko, one of its main competitors, calling it “awesome"" on Twitter.

The platform’s native asset, the SUI token, has been in the midst of an initial coin offering, or ICO, since April 20. It will end on May 3, when the mainnet goes live.

Investors have been purchasing IOU versions of the token, albeit from four smaller exchanges: BitForex, DigiFinex, HotBit and SuperEx. As of Tuesday afternoon, the token IOUs were trading at $3.20 according to CoinGecko, and had seen their price spike 14% in the past day from excitement surrounding the mainnet launch. After the token launches, it will be listed on OKX, Kucoin, Bybit, and Binance.

Is play-to-earn gaming dead? Maybe not, if P2Earn’s latest addition is any indication.

Video game industry veteran Jeff Burton, co-founder of gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA), has joined Canadian blockchain gaming company P2Earn as Chairman of its Board of Advisors.

AD

P2Earn is a publicly-listed Web3 gaming guild that plans to offer gamers an online platform, equipment, and access to video game NFTs in exchange for a percentage of their winnings. The platform is set to launch on Ethereum scaling network Polygon by the end of Q2 2023, according to a recent tweet.

“I am delighted to join the advisory board of P2Earn, as play-to-earn gaming prepares to go mainstream,” Burton said in a statement. “I have long believed that the concept of players earning a share of the profits through gameplay was the future of all gaming.”

Burton also believes in the potential of such “guild” models, which are similar to traditional gaming and esports industry organizations or “orgs.” He also suggested that play-to-earn gaming could enable “social mobility” and create a new economy unto itself. 

Burton has been professionally interested in crypto since at least 2017. According to his LinkedIn profile, he was previously on the Board of Advisors for BitDegree, which offers crypto courses.

He is currently also the Chairman of the Board of Advisors for Lithuania-based crypto game Engines of Fury, which is currently in beta and calls itself a “MOBA RPG”—that is, a mix between the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre and role-playing games (RPGs)—in which players can raid dungeons and fight monsters.

Play-to-earn gaming—in which players earn crypto token rewards for playing, usually with purchased or borrowed NFTs—caught fire in 2021 thanks to the rise of monster-battling game, Axie Infinity. In just a few months at the peak, Axie stacked up billions of dollars' worth of NFT sales.

But as that game's economy collapsed in early 2022 and the broader crypto market declined, the play-to-earn model fell out of favor as players criticized the simplistic gameplay and emphasis on financial reward over fun gameplay. P2Earn, at least, is betting that it will have a second life ahead.

In a memo sent to employees, Bloomberg reports, Samsung prohibited the use of the wildly popular chatbot due to concerns that employees were feeding ChatGPT sensitive corporate information. Samsung says in its notice that data sent to AI platforms like ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing are stored on external servers, may be hard to retrieve or delete, and could be disclosed to others.

“We ask that you diligently adhere to our security guideline, and failure to do so may result in a breach or compromise of company information resulting in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment,” Samsung said.

Like many technology companies, Samsung is very protective of its intellectual property, including hardware and software designs and product release roadmaps.

Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, the co-founders of 3AC, were among five people issued with a written reprimand by Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in relation to the recently-launched Open Exchange (OPNX).

The site, which went live last month, has been offering virtual asset exchange services without securing any regulatory licenses, according to a statement from VARA.

OPNX offers spot and futures trading and has also said it will launch a service allowing investors to trade bankruptcy claims for insolvent platforms like FTX and Celsius.

VARA officials say they issued OPNX and its founders with a Cease and Desist order in February, which resulted in some restrictions being applied regarding residents of Dubai and the rest of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, they were not applied comprehensively across all communication channels, leading to a second Cease and Desist notice in March.

OPNX then launched its exchange on 4 April, prompting VARA to issue an Investor and Marketplace Alert on the subject, before sending the written reprimand on April 18.

Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam, who co-founded the business with Davies and Zhu, were also addressed in the reprimand, as was OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb.

“Following the launch, and with the continued lack of satisfactory remedial action by the responsible parties, VARA is continuing to actively monitor the situation and investigate OPNX's activity to assess further corrective measures that may be required to protect the market,” the regulator said in its statement.

Decrypt has reached out to OPNX for comment regarding Dubai’s action.

CoinFlex, 3AC founders team up

Plans for OPNX first became public in January, when a leaked pitch deck showed that the four founders were looking to raise $25 million and would call the new exchange GTX “because G comes after F,” in a reference to the collapse of FTX. The name was later changed.

AD

The project is a collaboration between 3AC’s founders and the founders of the derivatives exchange CoinFLEX, which is currently in the process of restructuring.

OPNX uses CoinFLEX’s native token FLEX, while its CEO Leslie Lamb is both chief marketing officer at CoinFLEX and married to Mark Lamb.

Coinbase said it is committed to the U.S., but observed that countries worldwide are increasingly moving forward with responsible, crypto-forward regulatory frameworks as they attempt to position themselves as crypto hubs.

Coinbase said trades on the Coinbase International Exchange will be settled in USD Coin (USDC), and that the new exchange will have several security features, including real-time 24/7 risk management, dynamic margin requirements, and rigorous compliance standards.

Institutional clients in eligible non-US jurisdictions can also access the platform directly through an API, Coinbase said, although retail customers will not initially have access.

Content can be recorded and uploaded before, during, and after an event. 

Tickets for an upcoming Texas youth football championship game—set to seat up to 2,000 fans—will be listed on Box Office, for example. In addition to youth sports, Box Office expects to list both free and paid tickets from partnered music venues, nightclubs, business conferences, private parties, fitness and yoga studios, comedy clubs, religious retreats, and charity organizers. 

“As the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic, we expect that live events, concerts, and sporting events will regain their pre-pandemic popularity,” Johnna Powell, global co-head of ConsenSys NFT, said in a statement to Decrypt. “The combination of these factors suggests that consumer demand for NFT event ticketing will increase in the coming years.”

Lane claims SI’s Box Office has a 20% lower fee structure than Eventbrite. Fans can also transfer their tickets to NFT marketplaces and other secondary ticket platforms such as Vivid Seats, SeatGeek, and Stubhub to resell their Box Office NFT tickets.

AD

Sports Illustrated is offering a 50-50 revenue split on resales with event organizers and performers, and will do so by tracking the on-chain data of Box Office transactions.

“You always get paid when your ticket sells, but you don't participate in the resale of that on the secondary market—but that's what changes here,” Lane said.

“Your event is going to be listed on our site next to the biggest sports, concerts, and theater events in the area,” Lane said. “[Organizers] are no longer relegated to a hyperlocal Eventbrite-type of landing page. You're literally alongside Taylor Swift, Billy Joel, and the Knicks. It gives great visibility to any event that wants to partner with us.”

The NFL has offered free virtual commemorative NFT ticket stubs on Ticketmaster since 2021 for fans who purchased traditional tickets to attend games, while MLB’s partnership with Candy Digital also includes commemorative NFT tickets. Ticketmaster introduced an Ethereum NFT token-gating feature in March for artists to give their NFT-holding fans early access to tickets.

“[Box Office] is really about mass adoption of NFT ticketing—not novelty, niche, limited quantity drops,” Lane said. “This is something that everybody can use. It's applicable to every type of event. We expect this is going to be the entry point for millions to be able to enter blockchain and get their first NFT ticket.”

"Business","Coinbase Sued for Privacy Violations Over Users' Biometric Data","Business","Crypto exchange Coinbase is being sued for the unauthorized collection and improper use of customers’ biometric data and for violating Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, according to a lawsuit filed yesterday with a District Court in California. 

Plaintiff Michael Massel is seeking $5,000 in damages for every “intentional and reckless violation” of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and a further $1,000 for each other violation his legal team can find. 

AD

The suit alleges that Coinbase’s collection of biometric data through its Know Your Customer (KYC) practices—in this case, fingerprints and facial scans—were unlawfully obtained, used, stored and disseminated. 

According to BIPA rules, a company wishing to collect biometric data has to inform a person in writing that such data is being obtained, including the specific purpose and length of term for which the data will be stored. 

Written consent is also required from the customer and the company has to publish “publicly‐available written retention schedules and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric identifiers and biometric information.”

The suit argues Coinbase does none of the above when collecting customers’ biometric data both before and after creating new accounts.

According to the suit, Coinbase had no legal right to collect and store the data, so the facial recognition data collected prior to opening an account should have been destroyed after the customers’ accounts were opened, as should the fingerprint data whenever customers log out.  

Furthermore, the suit claims that Coinbase collects biometric data to “further enhance Coinbase and its online ‘app-based’ platform” and in doing so, “wrongfully profits” from the data. 

Lastly, the suit alleges that Coinbase “disclosed, redisclosed, or otherwise disseminated Plaintiff’s biometric information to numerous third parties including, but not limited to, Jumio Corporation, Onfido, Inc., Au10tix LTD, Solaris AG, and Liquid Co., Ltd.”

Decrypt has reached out to Coinbase for comment and will update this article should we receive a response.

Coinbase’s other legal challenges

Coinbase is also taking heat from U.S. regulators pursuing what the industry describes as a “regulation-by-enforcement strategy,” whereby agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) prefer to serve up lawsuits and legal threats rather than draft new guidelines for the still-nascent industry. 

Earlier this year, the SEC alleged that the staking services offered by exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase were unregistered securities and began a crackdown against them, issuing the former with a $30 million fine and the latter with a Wells Notice. 

The hostile climate appears to be driving Coinbase—a publicly traded U.S. company—further offshore.

"Business","Poloniex to Pay $7.6 Million In Sanctions Violations Settlement","Business","Crypto exchange Poloniex has agreed to pay $7.59 million to settle allegations that it allowed violations of international sanctions on its platform, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.

Between January 2014 and November 2019, the trading platform allowed customers who appeared to be located in sanctioned jurisdictions to make transactions.

AD

The value of these transactions amounted to around $15.3 million for 232 customers who were mainly in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but also in Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria.

The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces economic sanctions, said Poloniex had reason to know the locations of the accounts in question based on both Know Your Customer (KYC) information and IP addresses.

OFAC noted that controls introduced by late 2017 substantially reduced the rate of the alleged violations, as did additional compliance measures introduced when Poloniex was acquired by Circle in February 2018. However, some apparent violations continued in 2018 and 2019, related to a small number of accounts in Crimea.

“This action highlights that online digital asset companies – like all financial service providers – are responsible for ensuring that they do not engage in transactions prohibited by OFAC sanctions, such as providing services to persons in comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions,” a statement from OFAC said.

“To mitigate such risks, online digital asset companies should develop a tailored, risk-based sanctions compliance program.”

Regulatory fallout for ‘legacy’ business

In November 2019, the Poloniex platform was spun out by Circle as Polo Digital Assets and sold to an unnamed Asian investment firm. That deal did not include Poloniex’s U.S. arm, which Circle then wound down. The Treasury said Poloniex now has no business operations and no employees.

A Circle spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that the company had “agreed to assume certain potential regulatory liabilities associated with the acquisition of Poloniex”.

“We are pleased to put this legacy issue behind us,” they added. Decrypt has reached out to Circle and will update this article should we receive a response.

AD

The agreement follows a previous settlement in August 2021, when Poloniex agreed to pay $10.4 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle charges of operating as an unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange.

The mothballed business is not the only crypto exchange to have faced scrutiny relating to its sanctions compliance. Last year, working with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), OFAC fined Bittrex $53 million for facilitating a similar list of apparent sanctions violations.

"NFTs","Tensor Snatched Magic Eden’s Solana NFT Crown. But for How Long?","NFTs","The Solana NFT space got a shot in the arm with the late April launch of Mad Lads, a buzzy profile picture (PFP) collection that led the market-wide charts. But something else happened amid the trading surge: upstart marketplace Tensor topped the dominant Magic Eden.

Tensor launched in 2022, but saw increasing activity after introducing trading rewards in March. Last week, it clinched majority market share by trading volume on Solana. Data collected by Tiexo shows a slight lead by Tensor over the last seven days, with Tensor commanding 45% of Solana NFT market share and Magic Eden under 44%.

AD

Mad Lads helped push Tensor over the top, as traders apparently flocked to take advantage of its specific promotion around the NFT project rather than Magic Eden’s offering. But can Tensor maintain that momentum after waking Solana’s sleeping giant?

Tensor’s rise

Tensor began picking up considerable market share in March as it launched “loyalty” rewards for traders, echoing the move by Ethereum marketplace Blur that helped catapult it over OpenSea in February. The startup, which raised $3 million in March in a round led by VC firm Placeholder, similarly bills itself as a platform for “pro” traders with what it says is a faster, richer interface.

The Blur comparisons are intentional. Tensor looks and feels much like Blur, albeit for Solana, with a similar-sounding rewards initiative. The startup hasn’t specifically said that it will launch a token, but given that Blur gave out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens in February and said that it will continue doing so, it’s no surprise that traders are intrigued.

Mad Lads is the biggest thing in NFTs right now, as the Solana profile picture (PFP) project overcame alleged extortion threats and DDOS attacks to mint out last week—and has generated over $15 million worth of trading volume since.

Apr 27, 2023

Tensor’s market share steadily grew over the last couple of months, co-founder and CTO Richard Wu told Decrypt, but the upstart only leapfrogged above Magic Eden last week after the Mad Lads frenzy took hold.

Magic Eden also offered special promotions around Mad Lads NFTs. Magic Eden offered zero marketplace fees and also said it would give out 2,000 SOL (currently about $43,700) to airdrop to Mad Lads traders over the first 30 days after launch. It later said that it redistributed over 5,000 SOL ($109,400 as of today) worth of Mad Lads trading fees back to users.

Tensor, on the other hand, said that it would divert all of its marketplace fees on Mad Lads trades for the first 90 days to buying up “floor” (or the lowest-price) NFTs from the project, and then give them away via a raffle to traders. Today, Tensor tweeted that it has used 4,280 SOL ($93,650) worth of fees to buy up 58 Mad Lads NFTs to give them away to top traders.

Whether it was the promotion or an interface targeted at heavy traders, or perhaps the pairing of both, Tensor ultimately came out ahead as Mad Lads ruled the Solana market.

AD

“If you show people that you're truly about giving back to the community, and trying to make your product the best for Mad Lads or for the next NFT project,” Wu said, “then people will come and trade on your platform, and people will align with a Tensor versus a Magic Eden.”

War of words

There’s an “us versus them” dynamic in Wu’s comments that’s already been resonating across the Solana NFT community on Twitter for days. Tensor’s sudden rise to the top of Solana has inflamed past divisions that emerged over Magic Eden’s approach to the open-source Web3 ethos, as well as its moves around optional creator royalties last year.

On Friday, Magic Eden apparently discovered that Tensor was utilizing its content delivery network (CDN) to populate NFT images on the Tensor marketplace.

Magic Eden replaced the artwork on Tensor with images showing the Magic Eden mascot and logo, and tweeted, “Hey [Tensor], wen image CDN? We replaced some images on your marketplace. Just a harmless prank hehe. Let's build.”

Magic Eden deleted the tweet by Saturday following community backlash. Over the past several days, the vitriol has been flung back and forth on Crypto Twitter between the two camps and their supporters, and Tensor’s co-founders have themselves criticized Magic Eden and retweeted other critical tweets about the giant in the Solana space.

“They were in the dominant seat for so long that they felt they didn't need to do anything,” Tensor CEO and co-founder Ilja Moisejevs alleged in an interview with Decrypt. He believes that Tensor’s product is better than those of previous challengers, but also suggested that Magic Eden lost support in the Solana space as it rapidly expanded to Ethereum, Polygon, and Bitcoin.

“I think the community is also a bit upset with the way they've behaved in the last six months, because Solana has clearly gone through really turbulent times,” Moisejevs said.

He suggested that some Solana projects “doubled down” on the space amid the falling price of SOL and fears over the future of the community late last year, and believes Magic Eden did “almost the opposite” in pushing NFTs on other chains.

“They sort of took their foot off the gas when Solana was at its lowest point after FTX [collapsed], and that just rubbed a lot of people the wrong way,” Wu added. “If you're so bullish about building up Solana, why would you leave and build elsewhere at a time when Solana needed people to step up?”

Who wins?

Magic Eden responded to the social media pushback today, as marketing head Tiffany Huang told The Block that the startup is “excited to refocus back on Solana, which is our home,” and it “intends to show the Solana community that we have still got their backs.”

Huang clarified to Decrypt that Magic Eden’s renewed focus on Solana will come via product features and partnerships, including “innovating” on its Diamonds rewards feature that launched in late March as Tensor was on the rise. It will also include “programs that support creators and collectors,” she added.

She also pushed back against criticism by Tensor’s co-founders about Magic Eden’s current closed-source marketplace model, which requires it to co-sign transactions. That throws a wrench into how marketplace aggregators incorporate Magic Eden listings, and raises other concerns about security and composability. But Huang suggested that it’s essential—for now.

“The Tensor team knows and understands co-sign is not just an anti-aggregator tool—it's actually a critical part of some of [our] other core marketplace features,” she said, pointing to a tweet where Wu acknowledges as much. “The goal here is to become more open, but we just need to sequence these events so they don't disrupt our marketplace product.”

As the Mad Lads launch hype cools, the remaining question is whether Tensor can stay on top in the Solana space. Just before publication, Magic Eden had a slight lead in rolling 24-hour trading volume per data from Tiexo—but Tensor led that chart as recently as late afternoon today.

"Business","Crypto Companies Plead With UK Regulators Not to Follow the US","Business","In the eyes of some American lawmakers and businesses, the U.S. is stifling innovation with its sometimes confusing and often heavy-handed approach to regulating the crypto space. 

But Web3 companies are hoping the U.K. won’t go the same way. Today, a16z, the crypto-focused division of VC giant Andreessen Horowitz, asked the U.K. Treasury to take a more “nuanced” approach to regulation, adding that “the U.S. approach is not one that the U.K. should consider adopting.”

AD

The U.K. in February laid out its first rules to regulate crypto. In a consultation paper, the Treasury said it wanted to regulate crypto exchanges like other traditional finance venues. 

Head of policy at a16z Brian Quintenz said on Twitter Monday that they “enthusiastically embrace the U.K.’s approach for a ‘proportionate and focused, agile and flexible’ regime.” 

He added that the investment firm looked forward to continuing work with the Treasury in order to “establish world class rules which will protect consumers and allow this innovation to flourish.” 

Just last month, a16z warned that the U.S. was losing its edge in the digital asset space. The British government has said it wants the country to become a “global crypto asset technology hub.” 

a16z wasn’t the only one who spoke out about U.K. regulation today. Polygon Labs also responded by saying it was “incredibly encouraged” to see the U.K. making steps to regulate the industry. Polygon Labs Chief Policy Officer Rebecca Rettig added on Twitter that the U.K. consultation was “excellent.” 

Polygon Labs, the group of companies behind the Polygon blockchain network and 10th largest cryptocurrency MATIC, made suggestions to the Treasury. 

AD

In particular, it suggested that “unbacked cryptoassets”—cryptocurrencies which have no specific backing, like Bitcoin—should be “treated differently” from coins and tokens which have a team working behind the tech, or have their value tied to other assets.

Coinbase boss Brian Armstrong also last month said that the U.K. was “moving fast on sensible crypto regulation to both drive economic growth and consumer protection.” America’s biggest crypto exchange has said it is actively looking to rapidly expand overseas. 

Following the collapse of mega exchange FTX in November, the American regulators—particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission—have aggressively gone after major crypto brands to urge compliance. 

Under SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has gone after American crypto exchanges Kraken, Bittrex, and Coinbase for allegedly selling unregistered securities. 

But not everyone is happy with the crackdown: Republican politicians especially think regulators are forcing tech offshore. If that’s the case, the U.K. appears poised to welcome in any crypto companies that may become displaced.

The company argues that an easy-to-use self-custodial wallet is essential as an alternative to centralized exchanges and companies that handle sensitive user data. ""We are excited to bring the Phantom experience to the wider Web3 community,"" said Brandon Millman, CEO, and co...

The Phantom wallet has onboarded over 100,000 users since its Ethereum and Polygon support beta last fall, the company says.

Aside from broadening its user base with these additions, Phantom has also stepped up its security measures in light of a rise in phishing and scam attacks on NFT holders, including Kevin Rose and Seth Green. In January, Phantom said it had scanned over 85 million transactions and blocked over 18,000 wallet-draining transactions.

Future plans, Phantom said, are the introduction of instant NFT sales and the development of a bridge to enable the transfer of assets between the Solana and Ethereum networks.

“We believe that the future of digital asset management lies in cross-chain interoperability,” Brandon Millman, co-founder, and CEO of Phantom, said in a statement. “We’re committed to providing our users with the tools and resources they need to easily navigate and transact across various blockchain networks.”

"NFTs","Sotheby's Launches On-Chain NFT Marketplace for Secondary Art Sales","NFTs","Storied auction house Sotheby’s took its years-long embrace of Web3 a step further on Monday, launching a portal on its Sotheby’s Metaverse platform where secondary NFT artwork sales are conducted peer-to-peer and fully on-chain.

The addition to the Sotheby’s Metaverse platform, which initially went live in October 2021, features support for NFT artwork minted on Ethereum and scaling network Polygon, which Sotheby’s described as the “networks of choice for NFT creators and collectors” in a statement.

AD

The secondary sales on Sotheby’s Metaverse are facilitated entirely through automated smart contracts, the auction house said, and allow collectors to pay for art and collectibles in Ethereum (ETH) or MATIC, the token native to Polygon, using their own self-hosted digital wallets.

Sotheby's to Auction CryptoPunk, Other NFTs Owned by Bankrupt Three Arrows Capital

Storied auction house Sotheby’s announced Wednesday that it will facilitate the sale of an art collection called ""Grails,"" which is comprised of digital artwork that belongs to the now-defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and its Starry Night Capital NFT-collecting fund.

While OpenSea and Blur are notable examples of broad-scale, peer-to-peer NFT marketplaces that already exist today, Sotheby’s venue is distinct in terms of its offerings, which will consist of a “rotating, curated selection of leading artists” that are handpicked by specialists at Sotheby’s, it said.

Sotheby's said its selection of artists for the secondary marketplace will change every few months. And for its initial wave of artists, collectors can list and make offers on NFTs from 13 creators that the auction house has deemed as leaders in the digital art world, including Claire Silver, Sam Spratt, Tyler Hobbs, and the pseudonymous XCOPY.

Sotheby’s Metaverse is powered by Mojito, an NFT tech and commerce suite developed by Serotonin, a Web3 marketing firm and venture studio. Sotheby’s said it became an early investor in Mojito in 2021. 

Sotheby’s Vice President and Head of NFTs and Digital Art Michael Bouhanna described the measure in a release as an “important step forward” for the auction house—established in 1744—as it continues to evolve within the Web3 space.

The venue dedicated to secondary sales is also designed in a manner that honors secondary on-chain royalty fees specified by artists. A creator royalty is a fee taken from any secondary sales, typically 5% to 10% of the sale price, that is automatically sent to the artist's wallet. Sotheby's acknowledged that its decision comes amid a broader discussion about resale royalties in relation to NFTs. 

NFTs are unique digital tokens that represent the ownership of an item, often digital art. And in terms of tracking their history of ownership, the notion that blockchain transactions are recorded on public ledgers naturally lends itself to provenance.

Justin Aversano's Inspiration for Tarot-Themed NFT Photo Series 'Smoke and Mirrors'

Justin Aversano, best known for his high-selling ""Twin Flames"" NFT photo series, joined Decrypt’s Andrew Hayward ahead of the upcoming L.A. exhibition for his new Ethereum NFT project ""Smoke and Mirrors."" He shared the wild inspiration behind the tarot-themed collection, and why—despite his growing profile—he opted not to exhibit at a major brand-name gallery.

For example, Sotheby’s recently unveiled a collection of NFTs that consists of artwork seized from the bankrupt hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Titled “Grails,” the collection not only features work from notable artists and valuable projects, but the previous ownership of the NFTs featured also arguably makes them a part of Web3 history.

"Artificial Intelligence","‘Godfather of AI’ Leaves Google to Save Us From AI","Artificial Intelligence","Geoffrey Hinton, an artificial intelligence pioneer known as one of the ""godfathers of AI"" resigned from his position at Google so that he could openly express his concerns about how A.I. could cause significant harm to the world.

Hinton admitted in a New York Times interview that he now partly regrets his life's work. Despite the beneficial uses of A.I., Hinton fears that the technology could be used irresponsibly, unleashing unintended consequences.

AD

Hinton is worried that competition between tech giants like Google and Microsoft to create the most advanced A.I. will result in a global race that will not stop without some form of worldwide regulation. However, he was also emphatic in pointing out that he thought that Google has acted responsibly in its research:

Hinton is known for popularizing the theoretical development of neural networks in 1986 and for creating one capable of recognizing images in 2012. His work was crucial to the development of current generative art models like Stable Diffusion and MidJourney, and laid the groundwork for OpenAI's upcoming efforts to make GPT-4 capable of interacting with images.

His potentially belated move has many comparing him to J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physics professor credited with creating the atomic bomb.

The Risks of AI

One of the immediate problems Hinton highlights is the proliferation of fake images, videos, and text online, which could make the truth increasingly difficult to discern for the average person. As generative A.I. continues to improve, creators of fake and manipulative content could use these tools to deceive and confuse people.

Hinton is also concerned about how A.I. could affect jobs in the future. While chatbots like ChatGPT currently complement human workers, they could ultimately replace those who handle routine tasks, such as personal assistants, accountants, and translators. Although AI may alleviate some monotonous work, it could also eliminate more jobs than anticipated, disrupting social balance.

In the long term, Hinton fears that future versions of the technology pose a threat to humanity due to the unexpected behavior they may learn from the large volumes of data they analyze. This becomes a problem when A.I. systems are allowed to generate and execute their own code.

Meet Chaos-GPT: An AI Tool That Seeks to Destroy Humanity

Sooner than even the most pessimistic among us have expected, a new, evil artificial intelligence bent on destroying humankind has arrived. Known as Chaos-GPT, the autonomous implementation of ChatGPT is being touted as ""empowering GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity."" It hasn’t gotten very far. Yet. But it’s definitely a weird idea, as well as the latest peculiar use of Auto-GPT, an open-source program that allows ChatGPT to be used autonomously to carry out tasks imposed by the us...

This long-term view also gained particular relevance when other key figures in the A.I. field began to warn about the possibility of a ""foom"" scenario—in which AI far outpaces human intelligence—and the impact it could have on societal development.

AD

Hinton is just one of thousands of tech leaders and researchers alarmed by the exponential advancement of AI developments for various fields (from erotic chats to medical diagnostics). Last month, an open letter gained popularity in which leaders called for a pause in AI development until adequate controls are established. Hinton did not sign it.

The evolution of Hinton's position on A.I. reflects a growing awareness of the risks and challenges associated with rapidly evolving technology. For Hinton, resigning from his life's work was important to prevent a scenario that he says seems to be getting closer every day.

""Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,"" he told The New York Times. ""Take the difference and propagate it forwards. That's scary.""

"Business","Bitcoin Erases April Gains After Slumping More Than 5% in a Day","Business","Bitcoin on Monday slumped by 5.2%, erasing gains it had made in April when it rocketed above $30,000.

The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading hands for $28,275 as of 1.30 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko.

AD

That means the asset is also down 8.7% from the April high of $30,979 it hit just two weeks ago. Bitcoin had been on a roll: it surged past $30,000 for the first time in 10 months on April 10. It has now erased those gains.

But, overall, the coin is still doing well this year—it's up over 70% from the start of January, when it was priced at $16,615.

So if you bought in at the start of 2023, you're in great shape. If you bought anywhere near November 2021, not so much. Bitcoin, which has a market cap of $549 billion, is still down 58.8% from its all-time high of $69,044.

The rest of the biggest 20 coins and tokens were also in the red at the time of writing. Ethereum, the second biggest digital asset, was down nearly 5%, trading for $1,835.

While Solana, the 11th largest cryptocurrency, took the biggest 24-hour hit and dropped 6.8% to $21.92.

The crypto market, led by Bitcoin, has been doing well this year as investors continue to eye-up ""risk-on"" assets; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was expected to slow the rate of interest rate hikes following a banking crisis in the U.S., which makes volatile investments fair game again in the eyes of traders with at least a moderate appetite for risk.

Experts have also claimed that with a recession apparently around the corner, investors have been flocking to ""safe bets"" like Bitcoin and gold.

This narrative has been strengthened with the collapse of a number of banks in the United States. In March, regulators shut down Signature Bank, and tech-friendly Silicon Valley Bank went bust the same week.

Just today, regulators seized First Republic Bank; JPMorgan Chase agreed to buy most of its assets.

"NFTs","You Can Now Use Your JPEGs to Borrow Ethereum on NFT Marketplace Blur","NFTs","The NFT-backed loan market is gaining steam, with total loan value to date recently topping $1 billion across various protocols—and now the current largest Ethereum NFT marketplace by trading volume is getting in on the action, too.

Today, NFT marketplace Blur announced the creation of Blend, a peer-to-peer perpetual lending protocol based around NFT assets. Short for “Blur Lending,” Blend lets NFT collectors take loans out on their existing assets, and also lets liquidity providers earn interest by loaning out ETH with the NFT serving as collateral.

AD

Unlike some lending protocols, Blend does not have set timeframes for loans to be repaid. Instead, they’re perpetual, which means that they continue to accrue interest until repaid, or until the lender triggers a refinancing auction. This allows another lender to take over the loan, if desired, otherwise a liquidation auction can be triggered for the NFT collateral.

Furthermore, the loans do not rely on oracles, or external, off-chain data sources. That means that a loan on Blend will not look at NFT pricing data across marketplaces, which is used by some lending protocols (like BendDAO) to determine liquidation criteria.

In a tweet thread, Blur wrote that Blend ""enables 10x higher yield opportunities than current DeFi protocols and unlocks greater liquidity for NFTs."" Blend currently has no fees for borrowers or lenders, but BLUR token holders can vote to enable fees after 180 days.

Blur teased in a tweet thread that it will launch two “huge new products” today built around Blend. Full details on how the protocol works are listed in the official white paper.

The protocol was built in collaboration with Dan Robinson and the pseudonymous Transmissions11 from crypto venture capital firm, Paradigm, which led Blur’s own $11 million seed funding round back in March 2022.

Blur launched last fall as an upstart rival to the then-leading NFT marketplace OpenSea, with plans to offer token rewards to incentivize traders. The platform took the lead in the NFT space in terms of total trading volume this February after Blur’s initial token airdrop, as high-volume traders rapidly flipped assets to earn BLUR token allotments.

While the trading hype has fallen since February, Blur remains on top in terms of trading volume.

AD

Over the past week, Blur has commanded about 58% of NFT trading volume across marketplaces, per data from Dune, racking up about $98.5 million worth of trades. However, OpenSea still leads in terms of total trades, with about 47% share via nearly 80,000 trades.

The NFT lending market recently topped the $1 billion mark and continues to grow, with lending protocol NFTfi leading the charge with over $406 million worth of loans to date. BendDAO is second with about $308 million worth, per data from Dune.

"Business","Justin Sun Calls $56M Token Transfer to Binance an 'Oversight', Requests Full Refund","Business","Founder of Tron Justin Sun has apologized to Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao after the latter warned followers that Sun could use Binance's Launchpool platform to farm giant amounts of a new blockchain token called Sui.

CZ took to Twitter this morning after news broke that Sun had transferred $56 million to the exchange, warning him that Binance would “take action against it” if Sun then uses the funds to acquire Sui tokens on Launchpool. 

AD

The tweet that caught CZ’s eye came from the @whale_alert bot, an account that tracks large blockchain transactions. 

CZ went on to explain that Binance’s Launchpool platform is intended for retail users (individual investors, as opposed to institutions) and “not just for a few whales.” Launchpool lets Binance users farm new project tokens and acquire rewards by staking tokens like BNB and dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD (TUSD) in staking pools on the platform. 

Sun replied to CZ twenty minutes later with an apology, explaining that the transfer was due to an “oversight” stemming from TRON DAO’s market making partnership with TUSD and was emphatically not an attempt by him to hoard Sui tokens. 

He also shifted the responsibility for the transfer onto “team members [that] were not fully aware of the intended purpose for these funds and inadvertently used a portion of them to participate in exchange campaigns.”

In the same tweet, Sun claims the DAO has arranged a full return of the funds with Binance. 

CZ has yet to tweet an update on the situation. Binance did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

A Tron spokesperson told Decrypt that the $56 million refund has been executed.

Sui and Launchpool

The Sui network is a layer-1 blockchain created by Mysten Labs, a startup that was founded by former executives of Meta’s crypto division. 

It’s a proof-of-stake blockchain built using the open-source Move programming language, which was originally developed for Meta’s abandoned Diem crypto project. 

If this all sounds familiar then it’s because it’s pretty much the same pitch as Aptos, another recently launched newcomer Layer-1 blockchain developed by former Meta crypto experts.

Aptos Plans Network Upgrade, 'More Clarity' Around Token Distribution

In many ways, the crypto bear market adage about building has been ideal for Aptos. It took focus off the blockchain’s tokenomics, which drew a lot of criticism for being unveiled the day after its mainnet launch in October. A common refrain on Twitter at the time was that after raising $350 million at a valuation of more than $4 billion, Aptos should have been quicker to share details about how its native APT token had been distributed. Now, after months of hosting hackathons and securing partn...

Sui’s mainnet is slated to go live this Wednesday at 12pm UTC. Binance is facilitating the launch by making Sui the 33rd project to debut on its Launchpool platform. 

Snapshots of both users’ and pools’ balances are taken every hour and rewards are calculated each hour too; customers can unstake their funds at any time. The total farming period will run for two days after the launch of Sui’s mainnet.

When Sui’s liquidity meets Binance’s requirements, the exchange will then list the token under the SUI/BTC, SUI/USDT, SUI/TUSD, and SUI/BNB trading pairs. 

So far, users have staked nearly ten million BNB (over $3 billion) in Sui’s BNB Launchpool and half a billion over in TUSD’s pool.

"Business","Gemini Warns Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group of $630M Default Risk","Business","Mediation is underway to resolve the outstanding issues between DCG, Genesis, and Gemini.

Per an update, Gemini, Genesis, and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), as well as creditor committees agreed to initiate “a 30-day mediation process to drive to a final resolution as soon as possible.”

AD

“The mediation will be narrowly focused on DCG’s economic contribution to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of all creditors, including Earn users, and is designed to bring resolution to the Genesis bankruptcy plan,” read Friday's memo.

The company further indicated that an order from Bankruptcy Judge Lane to direct the mediation is anticipated to be issued as early as today.

Gemini Earn is Gemini’s now-discontinued high-yield investment service that had Genesis as a primary lending partner before the latter halted withdrawals in November 2022.

For Earn users, Gemini said, two important dates to keep in mind are May 8, before which two mediation meetings are planned to take place, and May 9 to 11, the period during which DCG is expected to pay the Genesis bankruptcy estate a sum of $630 million.

“If DCG is unable to pay and/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations. So while the mediation is scheduled for up to 30 days, the parties are expected to work expeditiously towards agreement in the immediate window,” Gemini said in a statement.

The crypto exchange added that “it is supportive of mediation and working with the parties to bring this to a conclusion.”

According to Gemini, the next conference on the status of the matter with the court will be held on May 4.

AD

Gemini and Genesis did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

A DCG spokesperson told Decrypt that the organization remains ""committed to doing the deal that all parties agreed to, and DCG will continue to honor its commitments on any outstanding obligations.”

What was the Gemini, Genesis saga?

The update comes in the wake of Genesis submitting a motion for the appointment of a sitting bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York to act as a mediator in its disputes against its creditors, including Gemini.

According to court documents, recent discussions have emphasized the need for a mediator to facilitate the resolution of a critical matter in the Chapter 11 proceedings: ""the amount, form, timing and other terms and conditions of DCG’s contribution to the Debtors’ reorganization plan.""

The filing further noted that DCG owes approximately $630 million to Genesis Global Capital in connection with certain fixed-term loans that are due during the second week of May 2023.

Commenting on last week’s developments, DCG said it couldn’t explain the motives behind the Genesis’ move, adding that “our understanding is that a subset of creditors has decided to walk away from the prior agreement.”

A 'Subset' of Creditors Walked Away From Genesis Deal: DCG

Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of collapsed crypto firm Genesis, said it couldn’t provide an explanation as to why a group of Genesis creditors decided to backpedal on the earlier settlements, but “remains committed to reaching a fair outcome” for all its creditors. “While it is difficult to understand the rationale given the limited engagement from Genesis creditors since the February court filing, our understanding is that a subset of creditors have decided to walk away from ...

The two sides reached an agreement “in principle” in February though.

The terms of the deal entailed DCG exchanging its existing $1.1 billion note due in 2032 for convertible preferred stock and refinancing its current 2023 term loans in two tranches, with an aggregate total value of about $500 million, payable to creditors.

Later that same month, DCG also confirmed plans to turn its Genesis Global Trading equity over to Genesis Global Holdco to eventually sell both companies and pay back clients.

One investor even managed to turn $250 in PEPE into $1.02 million in just a few days. They bought the token on April 15 swapping 0.125 Ethereum for 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens.

The bet then ballooned into a million dollars as PEPE pumped roughly 40,7900% in four days—the wallet continues to hold 3.9 trillion coins, worth just over $5.3 million.

The coin first began trading on April 15 at a price of around $0.000000001. The token was last trading at $0.00000137, per CoinGecko data.

What’s driving PEPE?

The meteoric rise of PEPE has occurred in lockstep with a similar rise in Google searches.

The Google Trend score for “pepecoin” surged from 3 to 100 from the week of April 9 to the week of April 16.

The score reflects the popularity of a keyword in Google Search in a given time period. The metric shifts between 0 to 100, with 100 representing the peak popularity for a particular keyword search.

Another factor potentially moving the price of PEPE coin is its listing on several cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, Huobi, Gate.io, and MEXC.

DeFi volumes for PEPE have also soared. Volumes around the token spiked from $2.99 million on April 15 in a Uniswap PEPE/WETH pool, to over around $240 million with multiple liquidity pools and centralized exchange listings.

Nansen’s Ethereum analytics dashboard shows that over 30 “smart money” wallets bought PEPE tokens worth around $1 million in the last week. The analytics firm tags very large and active traders in the “smart wallets” category.

Harmon pleaded guilty to criminal charges in January, faced with one count each of wire fraud and obstruction of justice, carrying a maximum sentence of 40 years combined.

The 712 Bitcoin in question—worth over $21 million at today’s prices—was taken by Harmon after the arrest of his brother in February 2020. According to the Justice Department, the funds were worth around $4.8 million at the time they were taken.

Larry Dean Harmon later pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy and charges associated with the improper transmission of money in 2021. In addition to criminal charges, Larry Dean Harmon was hit with a $60 million penalty by The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the first penalty levied again a Bitcoin mixer.

As part of that prosecution, law enforcement seized several assets, including a “cryptocurrency storage device” that couldn’t be accessed initially due to certain security features, the Justice Department said.

Gary James Harmon was able to “covertly” send himself 712 Bitcoins on the device by recreating Bitcoin wallets with his brother's credentials. Harmon then laundered the assets further, sending the freshly-taken bitcoin to two other online mixing services, authorities said.

When he agreed to hand over assets that stemmed from the 712 Bitcoin he took illegally, he agreed to forfeit cryptocurrencies that included 17.4 million Dogecoin, around 647 Bitcoin, and just over 2 Ethereum—altogether valued in excess of $20 million by the Justice Department.

"NFTs","Proof’s Kevin Rose on Building in the NFT Bear Market: ‘Holy Shit Has It Been Tough’","NFTs","Nearly one year to the day after the massive Moonbirds NFT drop, Proof co-founder and CEO Kevin Rose is standing outside a gallery show that the collective put on during NFT NYC 2023 week, telling Decrypt why his Web3 startup recently reasserted its focus on digital art, artists, and collectors.

“When everything is just ‘up and to the right’ and crazy and chaotic—like the whole crazy run-up that we saw [in the NFT market]—it's easy to lose your true north,” Rose explained. “Because you're just running, running, running, running, and you're so busy with all of the chaos that you don't have time to sit down and say, 'Okay, what do we really stand for?'”

It’s been a decidedly up-and-down year for Proof since the April 2022 Moonbirds mint. The Ethereum profile pictures (PFPs) saw enormous demand at the launch, generating some $280 million worth of trades within the first two days. Proof raised money off of the buzzy launch (and again a few months later) and quickly expanded its team with grand ambitions in mind.

Interview: Kevin Rose on the 'Weird Dynamic' of Building an NFT Project

Proof co-founder and CEO Kevin Rose chats with Decrypt Culture Editor Andrew Hayward during NFT NYC 2023 to discuss his startup's reaffirmed focus on digital art and collectors, the challenges of building in the NFT market, and what he's learned in the last year since the buzzy Moonbirds drop.

Go to video page

But the NFT market tumbled soon after the mint, and some holders weren’t on board with Proof’s decision to open-source Moonbirds artwork for anyone to use and commercialize. And some of its plans fell through: this year’s Proof of Conference event was canceled after lacking demand, and a planned Project Highrise “social universe” platform was also scrapped.

“It's a lot of work to do. Great businesses take many years to be built, it turns out. It can't be done in less than a year,” Rose explained. “I know we get some shit sometimes… [but] building in public is really difficult. And so if you show all of your dirty laundry, your community has to be willing to understand that it's messy along the way.”

Kevin Rose’s Proof: From NFT Drop to Growing Web3 Biz, With a CC0 Twist

The April launch of Ethereum project Moonbirds set the NFT space ablaze, generating $280 million worth of primary and secondary sales within two days as collectors vied for the latest buzzy profile picture sensation. But the story behind that electric debut started months earlier with the debut of the Proof Collective. Proof was the brainchild of Kevin Rose, the tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist, who co-founded the startup with artist Justin Mezzell. Rose, who famously co-created early so...

Rose recalled a bit of advice given to him by mentor Ben Horowitz, co-founder of VC giant Andreessen Horowtiz, who told him that “it’s better to be right than consistent.” And for Proof, that meant tightening its focus around digital artwork and collecting, and trimming projects that either weren’t working out or didn’t support that focus.

At NFT NYC, that renewed focus meant using Proof’s resources and connections to put on exclusive events for collectors. The aforementioned gallery show at Venus Over Manhattan, “Evolving Pixels,” was curated by generative artist Emily Xie (“Memories of Qilin” on Art Blocks) and featured a selection of works from generative and AI-assisted artists.

Rose said that Proof has already been focused on “curation with a point of view”—as seen with its exclusive Grails mints for Proof Collective NFT holders—but that it wanted to expand beyond its own ranks and tap other noted curators to join in, as well.

Proof also held an exclusive event with Mike “Beeple” Winkelmann—the artist behind the top NFT sale of all time—for just 400 of its community members, in which Beeple live-created a piece of artwork while taking suggestions from the crowd. Just 10 copies of the artwork were ultimately minted as NFTs and given to select attendees.

AD

While the core NFT NYC 2023 event felt significantly subdued compared to last year’s, the various side events hosted by projects, communities, and startups still captured flashes of the peak excitement seen around Web3. Rose said the vibes remained strong at the events he held or attended, but admitted that the NFT bear market has weighed on almost every creator.

“Holy shit have the last few months been tough, right? Every NFT collection has been impacted in some way,” Rose said. “But we're finally getting to a place where I think we're kind of bottoming out, and people are like, 'Okay, these are the people that are going to continue to build this space, and they're going to be for the next decade to come.'”

Rose gained prominence in Web2 as a co-founder of Digg who later landed at Google as part of an acqui-hire, and then turned venture capitalist with Google Ventures and later True Ventures—where he remains a partner. Working in the volatile world of Web3 and building in the open has been a real shock to the system, he said.

“No one's been a part of something like this that’s been this much of a roller coaster like that,” Rose said of the NFT market, “outside of, say, the stock market in general—but even that is way more defined and more stable than what this has been.”

For each thrilled NFT collector who bought an asset low and sold high, Rose said, there’s someone on the other side who bought the top and may be disappointed. Proof can’t control market fluctuations, but Rose said part of the learnings over the last year include how and when to communicate with collectors—and when to pivot, as needed.

“As an entrepreneur, it’s a really weird dynamic,” he admitted, adding that Proof’s products are focused on delivering events, NFT mints, and other exclusive opportunities that provide “value [that] has to be seen over years. It can’t just happen in three months.”

"Coins","Bitcoin Transactions Soar as Ordinals Barrel Past 2.5 Million, Notch Daily Record","Coins","Ordinals notched a new record on Saturday as the protocol used for inscribing digital assets on Bitcoin—producing assets comparable to Ethereum-based NFTs—had its busiest day yet.

The daily number of inscriptions made through Ordinals on Saturday totaled around 223,000, according to a widely-used Dune dashboard. It marked the first time over 200,000 inscriptions were made in a single day and suggests the protocol is as popular as ever as it enters its fifth month since launch.

In April alone, the daily record for inscriptions made was shattered four other times. That included roughly 72,000 inscriptions on April 2 and 193,000 inscriptions on April 23, according to the Dune dashboard.

Bitcoin NFT Mints Surpass 200K—But Is Interest in Ordinals Fading?

Ordinals took the Bitcoin network by storm in January, the hot new thing that dominated the conversation around the oldest and largest blockchain. On Monday, the number of Bitcoin Inscriptions crossed 200,000, according to data from Dune Analytics. Ordinal Inscriptions, similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin (BTC). Inscribing on satoshis, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is possible thanks to the Taproot ...

At the same time, the number of Bitcoin transactions neared levels not seen in several years, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. On Sunday, the firm said that the weekly average of daily Bitcoin transactions was around 396,000, its highest level since December 2017.

 

Looking at some of the latest inscriptions using ordinals.com, what once resembled a sea of images early on has morphed into a wall of text-based inscriptions. The tides began to shift last month as people discovered Ordinals could be used to create fungible tokens on Bitcoin, in a way that’s analogous to what one can do on Ethereum.

The trend was kicked off by a pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast named Domo, who created the “BRC-20” token standard as an experiment. And as of Sunday, close to 6,900 tokens using the new-developed standard have been launched, including several meme tokens with multi-million dollar market caps, according to data from brc-20.io.

North of 99.8% of the total inscriptions made on Saturday was text-based compared to just 272 image-based inscriptions, which represented 0.1% of the daily total. While not every text-based inscription is tied to fungible tokens, the ratio on Saturday represents a shift in Ordinals’ use compared to when the month began.

When the daily record for inscriptions made was broken on April 4, text-based subscriptions accounted for only 86% of the daily total, while image-based ones made up nearly 13% at 9,273.

Aside from the creation of fungible tokens under the so-called BRC-20 standard, Ordinals is opening the door to activity on Bitcoin in other ways, such as the Sats Name (.sats) standard that resembles name services built on Ethereum.

On Friday, the self-described NFT Historian @LeonidasNFT recognized recent developments in the Ordinals space, saying that “ordinals protocol innovation on Bitcoin has been increasing exponentially.”

That same day, the account celebrated a separate milestone for Ordinals, as the total number of inscriptions crossed 2 million. Just a couple of days later, the total number of inscriptions is now over 2.5 million, according to the Dune dashboard.

“It’s thrilling to see inscriptions growing the way they are,” Ordinals Project Communications Director Isabel Foxen Duke told Decrypt, “I’m concerned these numbers are inflated by a flood of inscription-generated BRC-20 tokens which are highly insecure and may pose a risk to retail investors.”

Indeed, some projects that have quickly embraced the experimental token standard have encountered headwinds, such as UniSat Wallet. Shortly after the digital wallet project—which supports inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens—launched its own marketplace, the service was compromised “due to a vulnerability in [its] codebase.”

UniSat Wallet indicated it will compensate users who were affected by the incident on Twitter, which it said had impacted 70 transactions. The project did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Decrypt.

Inscriptions are sometimes referred to colloquially as Bitcoin NFTs, but the process for creating inscriptions and how each one’s corresponding data is stored is distinct compared to digital assets that are created on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.

NFTs are unique digital tokens minted using smart contracts, where people interact with code that operates on decentralized protocols. They represent the ownership of an item, often digital art, and though it’s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum or Solana, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain.

AD

 lInstead of creating a token that’s entirely new, using Ordinals, people inscribe content like images or text to individual Satoshi, the smallest denomination that a Bitcoin can be divided into (1/100,000,000 BTC). And that content is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin’s blockchain.

Some metaverse game worlds are mocked for looking empty and feeling (or actually being) devoid of human life, but that was very much not the case with Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs’ Otherside Second Trip playtest late last month.

I dropped into a lobby filled with thousands—literally thousands—of other players, all running around, leaping, and flying through the air. And they were all talking at the same time.

AD

It was sensory overload… but also wildly impressive. While it’s true that everyone had a similar robotic tribal design and the lobby was simply adorned, perhaps reducing the technical strain, the Second Trip ultimately packed in some 7,200 unique players, per Yuga. And it ran just fine in my browser on a two-year-old MacBook Pro.

“I think it's really hard for people to understand when you turn on any other type of experience that's dubbed as the ‘metaverse,’ and there's not that dense of an experience, there’s not that many people in it,” Yuga Labs’ Chief Creative Officer Michael Figge told Decrypt after the event. “That's not what you find with Otherside.”

Granted, it was a scheduled event within a small chunk of the eventual Otherside game world, and it was the first such playtest in several months—for a game with over 22,000 virtual land owners (at the time) surely eager to see what they bought into. Even so, Figge said that keeping that level of activity as Otherside keeps testing and building towards a live product is key.

“How do we build in public and maintain that density,” he said, “and even scale that density up even further, so that more and more people find this as a thing that they want to come and be in?”

It’s a ‘Trip’

It’s a question that Yuga Labs is grappling with as it attempts to scale Otherside from last year’s massive NFT land drop and $1.25 billion worth of trading volume to date—per data from CryptoSlam—into a robust online world filled with Bored Ape-themed storytelling, social gameplay challenges, and NFT avatars of all kinds roaming the land.

Building in public and letting NFT holders in on what’s clearly still a work in progress is a different vibe than most traditional, AAA games. Some games launch in an “early access” mode, and many do a beta testing period in the ramp up to release, but Yuga’s demo felt even earlier in the process. The tech appears to be more firmed up than the content at this point.

A screenshot from the Otherside Second Trip lobby. Image: Decrypt

Once an intro session was completed in the Second Trip lobby, we all jumped through a portal into a jungle-like setting with “magic blobs” to collect and bring to giant, laser-spewing toads. In other words, it looked and felt more like the vibe of the Bored Ape Yacht Club universe than the sterile lobby arena.

AD

Yuga split the players into four teams led by Web3 personalities, such as content creator Bryce “Brycent” Johnson and Cordell “Champ Medici” Broadus (Snoop Dogg’s son). The team leaders goaded their respective players over voice chat to collect the most orbs and feed them to the toads. Thousands of players leapt and sprinted like mad to fetch the orbs, and in the end, the winning team was promised an exclusive “winged helmet” wearable NFT.

It was a big, social spectacle. But the experience lost steam before it was done, feeling like a monotonous fetch quest that stretched on for far too long. After 20+ minutes of the same routine, some players took to the chat feed to write missives like “boring” or “this is dumb.”

“This sucks pretty bad if this is the Otherside,” one player wrote.

Building in public

It’s not Otherside, at least not in its final form—but the early taste still creates expectations.

Figge and Yuga Chief Gaming Officer Spencer Tucker told Decrypt afterwards that they saw a range of comments from players, and that some enjoyed the orb collection routine thanks to the socially competitive vibe. Not every player is going to feel the same way. And it’s difficult to set expectations when serving up a limited slice of gameplay.

Masses of players stack up in the Otherside Second Trip world. Image: Yuga Labs

“I think what's important to keep in mind, and to keep the community grounded to, is this concept that we are building and we are testing together,” Tucker said. “This is a co-development with the players and the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Yuga, and the Otherside community more broadly.”

With these tests, Tucker explained, they’re surveying not only technical feedback and data points, but also sentiment and reactions from players. It’s an iterative process, in Yuga’s view.

“In order to figure out what features people need, we need to be moving to a model that opens us up every few weeks,” Figge said. “That's what you're going to see us rotating towards.”

If all goes to plan, Yuga Labs could be on track to open up the world to other builders by the end of this year, he suggested, enabling the creation of user-generated content that will live on Otherdeed land plots and supplement Yuga’s own work on the world.

“I think that a goal for success is that in December, we can all be asleep and somebody else is building on the Otherside—and they don't need us,” Figge said. “They're building their community, they're building activations and experiences of their own… and they have all the tooling to do that.”

Ours and yours

What does all of this add up to, then? What is the ultimate version of Otherside? Tucker and Figge described it to Decrypt as an online world where Yuga’s own official content can coexist with the creations of potentially tens of thousands of players and digital land owners.

An image from the Otherside Second Trip. Image: Yuga Labs

Figge pointed out that the smash games League of Legends and Dota 2 spawned from a fan game (Defense of the Ancients) created as a mod for Blizzard’s classic Warcraft III. In his view, Web3 provides a way for external creators to use Yuga’s building blocks while growing value within the original game ecosystem, plus it can benefit those creators as well.

“You can really motivate a creative economy that can spawn really, really compelling experiences,” Figge said, “as long as you can give the primitives and the Web3 rails to them. I think that is a really distinct model.”

How these two potentially disparate elements coexist remains to be seen, however. A proto-metaverse game like Roblox is entirely user-generated, with the 40 million games united by a simple interface. Likewise, Decentraland provides basic infrastructure and hubs and holds events with partners, but the space is mostly filled by brands and independent creators.

Tucker provided an interesting anecdote, likening Yuga’s mindset to Star Wars and the Expanded Universe of content. Granted, that’s all official content created under Lucasfilm and eventually Disney, but it provides a construct for thinking about what’s considered “canon” and what can be deemed alternate universe takes, “what if” tales, and so on.

“That's kind of up to us to arbitrate,” Tucker admitted.

But that sort of thing is already happening in the Web3 world, and especially around the Bored Ape Yacht Club—”what we might describe as layer-2s to our layer-1,” Tucker said, using blockchain terminology to describe derivative creations (“layer-2” content) by NFT holders that’s built on top of the “layer-1” brand and artwork developed and owned by Yuga Labs.

AD
Who’s in?

The other burning question about Otherside is how—or even whether—it will ultimately become a game that’s available to a mass audience. With Bored Ape NFT prices sitting around $92,000 worth of ETH on the low end right now, or even Otherside NFT deeds nearing $2,500, a fully exclusive experience would surely leave out most gamers.

For now, the answer is that Yuga Labs is really focused on its NFT holders, the people who have invested into the startup’s Web3 vision. And Yuga would rather give them the ability to bring along friends or even loan out their access credentials to bring in more users.

Figge pointed to the plus-one tickets for Second Trip given to Otherdeed land owners, saying that it let NFT holders “be the gateway” to bring pals into the ecosystem. And with Yuga’s recent standalone Dookey Dash web game, players could use the Delegate Cash service to enable another wallet to play the game without holding the access pass NFT.

“We think that's where the real sticky sort of behaviors will come from,” said Tucker, “and scale will unlock.”

It’s not the only learning that Yuga Labs took away from Dookey Dash. The endless runner-style game was all over Crypto Twitter for weeks, the Sewer Pass NFTs yielded $110 million worth of trading volume, and the winner received an NFT prize that he then flipped for $1.63 million worth of ETH.

It was buzzy, to say the least. Even people who mocked Dookey Dash, whether it was for its open embrace of toilet humor or the rising NFT access pass prices, ultimately helped it stay in the conversation in the crypto and gaming worlds. Tucker said that Yuga is trying to “create that virality of experience” across future games and “[crowdsource] growth to some extent.”

Given that its focus for now remains on NFT collectors, Yuga isn’t trying to hide the Web3 elements of its games or keep those users a relatively niche segment of the overall player base. But Figge believes Yuga’s games will be recognized for being fun above all, and even perhaps expand “the image of what a digital collectible can be.”

“One of our favorite things about Dookey Dash and Otherside is that you really do forget that you're interacting with NFTs,” he said. “You just think you're having fun.”

Bitcoin this week led a small market-wide rally after shares in First Republic Bank nosedived when the institution’s latest quarterly report revealed a decline in deposits. On Sunday, some of the leading cryptocurrencies appear to be shrugging off their intraweek gains, but there has been no explosive price movement in either direction. AI was a hot topic on Crypto Twitter this week. Electro-pop singer Grimes started the conversation on Monday when she offered 50% royalties to anyone that creates a hit using her machine-generated voice. In a follow-up tweet she said she would use smart contracts to issue the royalties.

Later in the week, Avenged Sevenfold singer and Ethereum maxi M. Shadows gave his two cents to Grimes’s proposal. 

On Tuesday, Neeraj Agrawal—who heads communications at pro-crypto policy think tank CoinCentre—solicited donations for some Bitcoin developers who are currently embroiled in a legal battle with notorious industry troll Craig Wright, an Australian software developer who claims to be the man behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. 

Bankrupt crypto lender Voyager broke the news that Binance US had axed a deal to acquire the company’s assets. Voyager was one of the high-profile casualties stemming from Terra’s collapse last May. In a statement to Decrypt, Binance cited “the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States” as the main reason behind the decision to back out. 

Solana announced a new integration with ChatGPT that day.

Avid tech fan @Odin_Free shared a pie chart highlighting how regulators have driven Ethereum principal deposits out of the Kraken exchange. 

Bitcoin briefly plummeted on Wednesday. Will Clemente, founder of blockchain research firm Reflexivity Research, was watching the red candles. 

It turns out the world’s favorite crypto had fallen 7% in an hour, starting shortly before erroneous reports that blockchain analytics firm Arkham had said wallets linked to the defunct Mt. Gox exchange and the U.S. government had moved huge Bitcoin stashes. Arkham CEO Miguel Morel told Decrypt that the transactions weren’t connected and Arkham later explained the situation in a post mortem on Twitter:

The following day, analytics firm Glassnode showed followers how to track the Mt. Gox and U.S. government balances in question.

The company itself has frequently mentioned the hostile regulatory climate in the U.S. recently and last week announced plans for global expansion, including Bermuda and, possibly, the crypto-friendly free economic zone, Abu Dhabi Global Market.

Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev returned to Twitter after he was released on bail to wait for his trial at home. Dutch authorities arrested him nine months ago on alleged charges of facilitating money laundering shortly after U.S. authorities sanctioned the crypto transaction privacy tool, claiming it was linked to North Korean state hackers Lazarus Group and may have laundered as much as $7 billion since 2019.

On Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin took a sharp nosedive—plunging 7% in an hour. It took most of the crypto market with it, too.

AD

The dip came shortly before erroneous reports claimed blockchain analytics firm Arkham had said wallets linked to defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox and the U.S. government had moved large amounts of Bitcoin.

It turned out to be a false alarm as a result of the DB Newswire account on Twitter mislabelling wallets on Arkham's platform, the company later said in a statement. But it led some to believe that the dip in prices came because the government started dumping large amounts of Bitcoin into the market.

But the fact remains that the government-owned Bitcoin and Mt. Gox coins are intriguing to investors: On Thursday, another blockchain analytics firm, Glassnode, said that the American government and the Mt. Gox trustee hold 205,514 and 137,890 Bitcoins respectively (over $10 billion in crypto)—and advised investors to keep an eye on the funds.

This is because when such large amounts of Bitcoin get transferred, it's market moving, according to experts.

But first, why does the U.S. government hold Bitcoin? And what’s Mt. Gox?

The Department of Justice last year seized more than $3 billion worth of Bitcoin affiliated with the dark net marketplace Silk Road. They then sold a huge chunk of it—and said they plan to sell more.

Mt. Gox, on the other hand, was a popular Bitcoin exchange that was forced to shut down eight years ago after a crippling hack. Once one of the biggest exchanges in the world, it closed in 2014 after losing 850,000 Bitcoins (today worth $24.9 billion) in the massive exploit.

Investors who lost their funds are still waiting to get it back from a trustee.

Christoph Ono, a contributor at open source Bitcoin resource Bitcoin Design, told Decrypt that the intrigue is all centered around risk.

He said: “Will the US government hold on to those Bitcoin forever? Or sell them off? If so, will they do it in a manner that reduces impact on the market or just dump in one go? Or auction them off? Who knows.”

The fascination with watching the wallets where Mt. Gox funds are being held is similar, he added. “I believe Mt. Gox is somewhat similar in that there are various unknowns,"" Ono said. ""At some point the coins will be released into the wild but no one really knows when and how.”

While Glassnode lead analyst James Check said that big investors may be interested in government coins.

“Periodically, the U.S. government auctions off these coins, which institutions in particular often find quite attractive, since they are in theory blessed and cleared by the U.S. government,” he said. In the past, some institutions have fretted over the provenance of crypto assets when buying them and worried they could be unknowingly buying from bad actors.

Whatever happens, investors are always keeping an eye on big HODLers—known as whales—especially unorthodox ones like the U.S. government.

“Roughly 10 billion dollars of bitcoin is an immense amount for the market to absorb,” Evan Kaloudis, the developer behind Zeus, a non-custodial Lightning wallet, told Decrypt. “I for one, though, am excited for the government to offload them to the market to circulate to new holders.”
